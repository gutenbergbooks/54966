<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">PREFACE</span></h2>
<p>The aim of this book is to serve as a companion to the <i>Mennonite
Hymnary</i>. It seeks to explain, as far as possible, the origin of the words
and music of every hymn in the <i>Hymnary</i>.</p>
<p>The great lyrics of the church, contributed by every age since the days
of the apostles, are a precious heritage, and a source of inspiration and
power. This work is intended to foster an understanding of and love
for our hymns, new and old, and to stimulate the time-honored and
blessed practice of congregational singing in the church today.</p>
<p>The <i>Handbook</i> may be found useful as an aid (1) in the private
study of hymns or their use in family devotions; (2) in selecting suitable
hymns for the many and varied services of public worship; (3) in preparing
special music services or hymn sings where such occasions are
planned to improve the singing in the church; (4) for study groups in
hymnology in churches and schools. The historical development of
hymnology may be followed in the brief &ldquo;<a href="#c3">Introduction to Our Hymns and Tunes</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The author has endeavored to make the work as comprehensive as
possible without overburdening the reader with too many details. Many
hymns have interesting stories connected with their origin and use while
others, equally valuable, were just written, without drama or incident,
the poet scarcely knowing how or why, except that the Inner Voice
spoke. The apocryphal tales which have been circulated concerning
some hymns have been studiously avoided. The aim has been to include
only such material as seems to bear genuine marks of authenticity.
The bibliography of &ldquo;Principal Works Consulted,&rdquo; found elsewhere in
the book, indicates the main sources.</p>
<p>The original versions of translated hymns are not always readily
available and for that reason they are reproduced in the <i>Handbook</i>.
Translated hymns are usually selections from a much larger number
of stanzas and it is often instructive to be able to study the whole structure
of the original work.</p>
<p><i>Acknowledgements.</i> I wish to acknowledge valuable help received
from the following and to express hereby my gratitude to them: to Dr.
Robert McCutchan, author of <i>Our Hymnody</i>, who generously responded
to my request for information on a dozen or more hymns on which I
had no data; to Dr. Henry Wilder Foote, of Harvard University, author
of <i>Three Centuries of American Hymnody</i>, for biographical material on
several hymn writers, and the use of books from his private library; to
<span class="pb" id="Page_x">x</span>
Dr. Reginald McAll, Executive Secretary of the Hymn Society of America
for helpful material; to Dr. Ruth Messenger, Archivist for the Hymn
Society of America, who furnished nearly all the Latin originals, and the
Italian original of Savonarola&rsquo;s hymn, and information concerning these
hymns; to Dr. Armin Heussler, author of a forth-coming handbook to
the <i>Evangelical hymnal</i>, for material on several of the chorales; to Wm.
Runyan of the Hope Publishing Company, and to Dr. John Trowbridge
of the Bible Institute of Los Angeles, for information concerning
several of the gospel songs; to Dr. Cornelius Krahn who made the rich
hymnic treasures of the Mennonite Historical Library at Bethel College
available to me; to the late Rev. C. E. Krehbiel who loaned me material
from his private library for this work but did not live to see its
completion; to B. Bargen for help in preparing the manuscript for publication;
to Mrs. Beatrice Buller for reading the manuscripts and proofs
of the German chorales; to my wife, Charity Steiner Hostetler, who
read all the manuscripts and proofs and whose constant interest and
assistance were indispensable; and to others, too numerous to mention,
who in any way facilitated the completion of the work.</p>
<p>The book, written during spare moments of a busy pastorate, is sent
forth with the prayer that, in spite of errors and imperfections, it may
inspire all who use it to sing with greater devotion the praises of Him
who loved us and redeemed us.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">EXPLANATORY NOTES</span></h2>
<p>In the interest of brevity and to avoid repetition, certain recurring
words are abbreviated:</p>
<p><i>Hymnary</i> is used for <i>Mennonite Hymnary</i>.</p>
<p><i>c.</i> (<i>circa</i>) means approximate date.</p>
<p><i>Tr.</i> is prefixed to the names of all translators.</p>
<p><i>Anon.</i> (anonymous) means without any name acknowledged, as that
of author or composer.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;Number&rdquo; has been omitted: thus Hymn 22 means Hymn
No. 22.</p>
<p><i>Cf.</i> means compare. (Latin: confer).</p>
<p>The original texts of German hymns found throughout the <i>Handbook</i>,
especially in the section of Chorales, Book IV, are the versions
used in one or more of the following works: <i>Gesangbuch mit Noten</i>,
(Berne, Ind., 1890); <i>Gesangbuch der Mennoniten</i>, (Canadian, 1942);
<i>The Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal</i>, (Concordia Pub. House, 1942);
<i>Gesangbuch zum gottesdienstlichen und h&auml;uslichen Gebrauch in Evangelischen
Mennoniten-Gemeinden</i>, (Konferenz der s&uuml;ddeutschen Mennoniten
zu Ludwigshafen a. Rh. 1910); and Knapp, <i>Evangelischer
Liederschatz</i>. Many variations occur in the texts as found in these
versions, the explanation of which would require a much greater knowledge
of German hymnody than the author possesses. An effort has been
made to bring the spelling into conformity with the modern German
practice of omitting the &ldquo;h&rdquo; where it was formerly used with the &ldquo;th&rdquo;;
the use of &ldquo;ss&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;sz&rdquo;; and printing the initial letter of the
pronouns referring to Deity, in lower case rather than with capitals.</p>

<h3 id="sect1">1. Definition of a Hymn.</h3>
<p>St. Augustine, 354-430, gave a definition of a hymn, which has been widely accepted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A hymn is the praise of God by singing. A hymn is a song
embodying the praise of God. If there is merely praise but not
praise of God it is not a hymn. If there be praise, and praise of
God, but not sung, it is not a hymn. For it to be a hymn, it is
needful, therefore, for it to have three things&mdash;praise, praise of
God, and these sung.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A recent definition, accepted by the Hymn Society of America, is that
of the late Carl F. Price:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Christian hymn is a lyric poem, reverently and devotionally
conceived, which is designed to be sung and which expresses the
worshiper&rsquo;s attitude toward God, or God&rsquo;s purposes, in human
life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>L. F. Benson, America&rsquo;s foremost hymnologist, defines a hymn in these
simple words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Christian hymn ... is a form of words appropriate to
be sung or chanted in public devotions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A hymn is to be sung <i>by a congregation</i>. Its message must be simple,
not subtle. It must read well and sing well. In modern usage, the hymn
is not limited to the praise of God but includes other moods of worship
such as resignation and consecration.</p>
<h3 id="sect2">2. The Beginnings of Christian Song.</h3>
<p>Hymn singing has always
been associated with Christian worship. Jesus and the Twelve sang a
hymn, presumably a portion of the <i>Hallel</i> (Ps. 115-118), after the Supper
was ended. Paul and Silas sang hymns, &ldquo;songs of the night,&rdquo; during the
<span class="pb" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
midnight hours of their imprisonment in Philippi. The great Apostle
recognized the value of song when he exhorted the churches thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be filled with the Spirit; speaking to yourselves in psalms and
hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your
heart to the Lord. Eph. 5:18, 19.</p>
<p>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom;
teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns
and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the
Lord. Col. 3:16.</p>
<p>I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding
also. I Cor. 14:15.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Jewish converts who at first composed the church had a rich
heritage of song in the Book of Psalms. This was their hymnbook, used
in the Temple worship and in the home and probably also in the synagogue
services. The use of the Psalms, carried over from the Jewish
service, forms to this day an important element in Christian worship.</p>
<p>Besides the Psalms, the early church sang the nativity lyrics that adorn
the first two chapters of the Gospel of Luke. It also made extensive use
of <i>Hallelujah</i> as a part of the people&rsquo;s praise, adding, in the course
of time, the <i>Gloria Patri</i>, the <i>Sanctus</i>, the <i>Te Deum</i>, and other canticles.</p>
<p>The nativity hymns in Luke, five in all, are extensively used in Roman
Catholic and Anglican services.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Ave Maria</i> (Hail Mary). 1:28-29, 42-45. The salutation of Gabriel
and of Elizabeth.</p>
<p><i>Magnificat.</i> &ldquo;My soul doth magnify the Lord....&rdquo; 1:46-55.
Hymn of the Virgin Mary.</p>
<p><i>Benedictus.</i> &ldquo;Blessed be the Lord God of Israel....&rdquo; 1:68-79.
Song of Zacharias.</p>
<p><i>Nunc Dimittis.</i> &ldquo;Lord, now lettest Thou thy servant depart in
peace.&rdquo; 2:29-32. Song of Simeon.</p>
<p><i>Gloria in excelsis.</i> &ldquo;Glory to God in the highest....&rdquo; 2:14.
Song of the Angels. Used as a part of the Roman mass and
often found in Protestant hymns, e.g., &ldquo;Angels we have heard
on high&rdquo; <a href="#hymn_82">82</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sect3">3. Hymns of the Eastern Church: Greek and Syriac.</h3>
<p>The
ancient Eastern Church developed a rich hymnody, rising steadily in
the fourth century until it reached its culmination in the eighth and
<span class="pb" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
ninth centuries. Since it employed the Greek and Syriac languages, its
hymnic treasures remained almost completely hidden and unknown to
the English speaking churches for many centuries. It is only in recent
years, through the efforts of scholars like John Mason Neale and Edward
Caswall that some of the Eastern hymns have been translated and made
available for modern use. Eastern hymns are characterized by an objective,
dignified, contemplation of God. Except when confessing sin
and unworthiness, they contain nothing of the subjective feelings of the
worshipper such as is found in many modern hymns. Though there is
very little in the <i>Hymnary</i> from the Eastern Church, our collection is
enriched by the inclusion of a small number of hymns from this source.</p>

<h3 id="sect4">4. Hymns of the Western Church: Latin.</h3>
<p>Two great names are
associated with the music of the Western Church: Ambrose, c. 340-97,
known as the &ldquo;Father of Hymnody in the Western Church;&rdquo; and Gregory
the Great, 540-604, the missionary-minded pope, and reformer of
church music.</p>
<p>Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, not only composed hymns and music but
stimulated others to do the same. Under his leadership there developed
a large body of church music based upon four scales, which came to be
known as Ambrosian Chant. Although widely known as a scholar, theologian,
and preacher, Ambrose&rsquo;s most lasting influence was upon the
music of the church. None of his hymns are found in our collection.</p>
<p>Gregory the Great, two centuries later, carried forward the work of
Ambrose. He added four more scales or modes to the Ambrosian system,
thus giving to the repertory of church music more definiteness and variety.
The music that developed during the papacy of Gregory came to be
known as Gregorian Chant, or plainsong, or plainchant. It is &ldquo;plain&rdquo;
because unadorned, unharmonized and unmeasured. Its rhythm is the
free rhythm of speech, the beats falling irregularly. The Gregorian
Chant remained the music of the church for a thousand years and forms
the basis of all Roman Catholic music today. Some of these chants were
adapted by Luther for congregational singing, and set to words in the
vernacular of the people. A few of the tunes, usually in a form scarcely
<span class="pb" id="Page_xv">xv</span>
recognizable from the original, are used today in Protestant hymnals, as
for instance, the tune &ldquo;Hamburg.&rdquo; Some of the music in the Amish
church services is traceable to the Gregorian Chant.</p>
<p>The singing in the medieval church was liturgical in character and
confined to the clergy and trained choirs. This was its weakness. The
laity was not expected to sing, neither were they able to do so. Congregational
singing, so important in our worship today, had for centuries
been unknown in the Roman Catholic Church. Reform was inevitable
and it came in due time.</p>
<p>While only remnants of the music survive, many hymns from the
Western Church have been translated from the Latin and a few choice
ones have found their way into the <i>Hymnary</i>.</p>

<h3 id="sect5">5. Hymns of the Bohemian Brethren.</h3>
<p>The followers of John Hus
who came to be known as the Bohemian Brethren, and later as the
Moravians, were the first Protestant group to introduce congregational
singing into their worship. They also published the first Protestant
hymnbooks, one in 1501 and another in 1505, containing 89 and 400
hymns, respectively, in their native Bohemian tongue. Their efforts to
introduce congregational singing were sternly opposed by the Roman
hierarchy. The Council of Constance condemned Hus to be burned at
the stake and warned his successor, Jacob of Misi, to cease the singing
of hymns in the churches. It decreed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If laymen are forbidden to preach and interpret the Scriptures,
much more are they forbidden to sing publicly in the
churches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result of their persecution, the Brethren in 1508 sent out messengers
to search for true Christian people into whose communion they
might apply for admission&mdash;one to Russia, one to Greece, one to Bulgaria,
<span class="pb" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>
and one to Palestine and Egypt. All returned unsuccessful. No
such Christians had been found. They therefore remained in their own
country, giving themselves assiduously to the translation and printing of
the Bible.</p>
<p>In 1522 the Brethren sent two messengers to Luther to greet him and
ask his advice. Luther became interested in them and welcomed their
fellowship. He was impressed with the hymnbook the Brethren had
published, and later used some of the hymns in his own work.</p>
<p>Two centuries later, the Brethren, known now as the Moravians,
settled on Count Zinzendorf&rsquo;s estates in Saxony, spreading rapidly from
thence into other countries in Europe and to the United States. One of
England&rsquo;s foremost hymn writers and hymnologists, James Montgomery,
was an adherent to their faith.</p>

<h3 id="sect6">6. Hymns of the Reformation: the German Chorales.</h3>
<p>The
movement toward congregational singing, inaugurated by the Bohemian
Brethren, was soon to be merged into the greater Reformation movement.
Luther&rsquo;s influence on the worship and music of the church was
revolutionary. For a thousand years the laymen had had no part in
church song. Congregational singing was unknown. Ambrosian music
had at first been introduced for congregational use but it became more
and more liturgical, thrusting the laity into the background. The Gregorian
Chant which followed was never intended for use except by the
priests and trained choirs. The followers of Hus pioneered in congregational
singing; but it was Luther and his followers who brought it
into full fruition.</p>
<p>Luther was a born music lover and a musician of adequate training.
Moreover he possessed a remarkable gift for writing hymns in clear
thought to bring the Word of God home to the hearts of the common
people. He and his followers put songs on the lips of the German people
and they sang themselves into the Reformation. So effective were
these songs that his enemies in the Roman church declared that &ldquo;Luther&rsquo;s
songs have damned more souls than all his books and speeches.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xvii">xvii</div>
<p><i>Chorales.</i> The word &ldquo;chorale&rdquo; (&ldquo;choral&rdquo; in German) refers
to the hymn tunes of Lutheran Protestantism, though in common usage the term includes
the words associated with the tunes. The melodies had much to
do with the popularity of the songs. They came from various sources.
Many of them were original compositions by Luther and others; some
were borrowed from the hymn books of the Bohemian Brethren; a considerable
number were adaptations of plainsongs used in the Catholic
Church; still others were adopted from beloved folksongs. Luther was
an eclectic in his choice of music. He used any tune from any source
that suited his purpose. Many thousands of chorales came into existence
in Germany during his time and the two centuries that followed. The
hundreds still in use represent the best in church music today. They are
characterized by a plain melody, a strong harmony, and a stately rhythm;
all of which adapts them well for effective congregational singing.</p>
<p>The chorales at first did not have the regular rhythms that they later
took on. The steady progression of even notes, invariable in Bach&rsquo;s day,
had come only gradually into use. Some of the recent hymnbooks, in the
interest of greater variety of rhythm, are returning to the original
&ldquo;rhythmic chorales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though <i>unison</i> singing has been widely practiced and is advocated
today by some good authorities in church music, Luther encouraged
part singing. In his first Preface to the <i>Geystliches Gesangb&uuml;cklin</i>, 1525,
he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These songs have been set in four parts, for no other reason
than because I wished to provide our young people (who both
will and ought to be instructed in music and other sciences)
with something whereby they might rid themselves of amorous
and carnal songs, and in their stead learn something wholesome,
and so apply themselves to what is good with pleasure, as becometh
the young.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The period of the German chorales may be said to have begun with
Luther, 1483-1546, and ended two centuries later with J. S. Bach, 1685-1750.
Bach brought the chorale tunes to their highest perfection, using
many of them in his larger choral works. He composed about 30 original
chorale melodies, wrote reharmonizations for approximately 400, and
composed many chorale preludes for the organ which are in wide use
today.</p>
<p>The German hymns and chorale tunes, used constantly in the home
and school, as well as in the church, have been of great importance in
our Mennonite worship in the past. They constitute the main body of
material in all our German collections of hymns. In an effort to preserve
and emphasize this rich heritage, there was incorporated into the
<i>Hymnary</i>, a special section, Book III, made up exclusively of chorales.</p>

<h3 id="sect7">7. Hymns of the Reformation: The Metrical Psalms.</h3>
<p>While the German people, under the leadership of Luther, were singing chorales
set to original religious poems, a large section of Protestantism,
under the influence of John Calvin, confined itself to the singing of
<span class="pb" id="Page_xix">xix</span>
Psalms. To the French reformer, now preaching at Geneva, hymns were
&ldquo;man-made,&rdquo; whereas the psalms were the inspired word of God and the
only proper vehicle for the praise of God. Calvin, unlike Luther, was
not a musician, and at first permitted only unison singing, unaccompanied.
Part singing and instrumental accompaniment seemed to savor of
the frivolous and worldly, an opinion which Calvin, however, was soon
to modify. For two hundred years the Calvinistic churches on the Continent
and in Britain were influenced in their worship song by the strict
views of Calvin, limiting themselves to the metrical psalms and scriptural
paraphrases. The German people in the meantime produced a rich treasury
of original religious lyrics, contributed by some of their best poets.</p>

<h3 id="sect8">8. Psalm Versions.</h3>
<p>The use of the psalms in singing, first on the
Continent, then in England and Scotland, and later in America, brought
forth many metrical versions of the psalter, the principal ones being the
following:</p>
<p>a. <i>The Genevan Psalter</i>, begun 1539, published complete in 1562. It
was made at the request of John Calvin by Cl&eacute;ment Marot, court poet of
France, and Theodore Beza, a French scholar. It became the psalm book
for the Reformation churches on the continent, and is spoken of as the
most famous book of praise the Christian Church ever produced. It was
issued in at least one thousand editions and translated into a number of
tongues. Some of the original tunes are still in use, e.g., &ldquo;Old Hundredth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>b. <i>The Anglo-Genevan Psalter</i>, Geneva, 1556. This was used by
John Knox, the Scottish reformer, and his followers who fled the persecutions
of &ldquo;Bloody Mary,&rdquo; and formed a congregation at Geneva. The
book incorporated some of the Sternhold and Hopkins versions which
were in use in England, and added others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xx">xx</div>
<p>c. <i>The Old Version</i>, Sternhold and Hopkins, completed in 1562.
Used in England for 134 years. It is entitled, <i>The Whole Booke of
Psalmes</i>, but came to be known as the &ldquo;Old Version.&rdquo;</p>
<p>d. <i>The Bay Psalm Book</i>, Boston, 1640. This was the first book
printed in English-speaking America. It was made to obtain greater
literalness to the Hebrew original than was found in the versions then in
use. The book reigned supreme among the English churches in New
England for over a century. Seventy editions of it were printed in
America, the last in 1773. Eighteen editions appeared in England, and
twenty-two in Scotland. There were no tunes given it until 1698, then
only 13, with the air in the bass.</p>
<p>e. <i>The Scottish Psalter</i>, completed 1650. Special mention is made of
this version of the Psalms because it is the source of nearly all the selections
of metrical psalms which constitute Book Five of the <i>Hymnary</i>.
The number of versions and editions of psalms which appeared on the
Continent and in England were numerous and confusing, each claiming
its own special merits. Finally, in the interests of better literary diction
and greater unity in singing in the Scottish Presbyterian churches, the
General Assembly authorized a new version. The result, after many
years&rsquo; work, was the famous <i>Scottish Psalter</i> of 1650 which remains the
standard work in Scotland today.</p>
<p>There is a certain &ldquo;dignified crudeness&rdquo; in some of the literary expressions
but the psalms have long been learned in this version and
have become an important part of the religious training and experience
of millions of English speaking people, especially in Scotland.</p>
<p>The Scottish Psalter first appeared with words only. There were no
notes and no suggestions for melodies. The succeeding one hundred
years were a time of confusion. The tunes used were few in number,
such as the leaders had learned from various sources, and passed on to
succeeding generations by rote. The time came when better singing and
better tunes were demanded and gradually the psalter appeared with
tunes. Early tune versions put the melody invariably in the tenor. The
latest edition, printed in 1929, by the Oxford Press, contains the best
Psalm tunes which had gradually come into use, many of them arranged
with &ldquo;Faux-bourdon&rdquo; (wherein the congregation sings one or more
verses to the melody while the choir supplies the harmony), and &ldquo;Descant&rdquo;
(a second melody over that of the tune).</p>
<p>f. <i>The New Version</i>, Tate and Brady, London, 1696. This version
gradually supplanted the <i>Old Version</i> of Sternhold and Hopkins, and
held its place in the worship of the church for 150 years. It was adopted,
in 1789, by the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States and
bound with the prayer book of that Communion.</p>
<p>The above versions are only a few of the large number of psalters
that were published by the Calvinistic churches on the Continent, in
<span class="pb" id="Page_xxi">xxi</span>
Great Britain, and in America. The metrical psalms were designed for
the singing church. They were intended to restore song to the people in
their worship, serving in this respect a similar purpose to the chorales in
Germany.</p>
<p>Some of the psalm books were published without music, some with the
melody only, and others in four-part harmony. The statement is frequently
made that Calvinistic Protestantism approved only unison
singing. The appearance of numerous books, complete with four voice
parts, points to the contrary. It is true that Calvin at first encouraged
unison singing only, regarding harmony more in the nature of amusement
than the worship of God; but upon observing the effectiveness of
singing in Germany, he soon changed his views and became more liberal
in this respect.</p>
<h3 id="sect9">9. English Hymnody.</h3>
<p>The youthful, courageous Isaac Watts, 1674-1748,
an ardent dissenter, pioneered the movement which resulted in a
flood of hymns and hymnbooks in the English churches. Watts was not
satisfied with the psalm singing of his time, which by now had become
formal and lifeless. Parts of the psalter, he pointed out, were obviously
not written in the spirit of the Gospel. &ldquo;By keeping too close to David,&rdquo;
he wrote in one of his Prefaces, &ldquo;the vail of Moses is thrown over our
hearts.&rdquo; Watts removed that &ldquo;vail,&rdquo; Christianizing the psalms
and composing during his lifetime more than 600 original hymns, expressing in
the language of the time, the thoughts of the worshippers. Through his
influence, his age, the 18th century, became the first age of hymn singing
in England.</p>
<p>John and Charles Wesley, following Watts, made enormous use of
hymn singing in their evangelistic work, giving the movement for congregational
singing a powerful impetus. Charles is said to have composed
over 6,000 hymns.</p>
<p>From the Wesleys onward through the 19th century, the hymn writers
in England became numerous. The restrictive shackles of psalm singing
had been broken and the creative urge to worship in new forms
resulted in a vast number of original religious lyrics and the publication
of hundreds of hymnbooks. The development can be summarized here
only in outline form.</p>

<h3 id="sect10">10. American Hymns.</h3>
<p>The English speaking colonists who settled
in America during the 17th century continued the psalm singing traditions
of their forebears in England. The practice prevailed in their
churches for two hundred years. The first book printed by them was the
<i>Bay Psalm Book</i>, in 1640, at Cambridge, Massachusetts. It contained no
original hymns. The singing of psalms, and later of hymns borrowed
<span class="pb" id="Page_xxv">xxv</span>
from England made up nearly the entire repertory of church music until
the middle of the 19th century.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the German speaking colonists, including the
Mennonites, had brought with them the hymn books of the Lutheran
tradition and continued the use of the German chorales in their worship.
The two streams of hymnody, English psalms and German chorales,
went their independent courses for two centuries, scarcely influencing
each other.</p>
<p>In the meantime there was very little original hymnody produced in
America, with the exception of the work of the Wesleys during their
brief experiment in Georgia, and the composition of certain hymns and
tunes by the German people of Pennsylvania, which have remained, until
recently, in manuscript form. Timothy Dwight&rsquo;s hymn on the
church, &ldquo;I love Thy Kingdom, Lord&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_275">275</a>) is probably the earliest
American hymn still in use.</p>
<p>After the middle of the 19th century the number of hymn writers
became large and their works came into increasing use, some choice examples
finding their way into English hymnbooks. America&rsquo;s original
contribution to Christian hymnody has not been only the Gospel Songs
represented by the writings of Fanny Crosby, but the more permanent
works of Whittier, George W. Doane, Hosmer, Samuel Longfellow,
Washington Gladden, S. F. Smith, and many others. Our musical contributions
have been less conspicuous, but the tunes of Mason are coming
into their own again and many of them will doubtless survive for a
long time, as will also those of Bradbury, Hastings, and others.</p>
<p>The tendency today in American hymnbooks is to unite the best in
English and German traditions. The <i>Hymnary</i> illustrates this trend.
It makes large use of the English hymns while at the same time preserving
a considerable body of the German chorales. In keeping with this
trend, the recent hymnbooks of the Episcopal, Presbyterian, Methodist
and other churches of English origin, incorporate some of the German
chorale tunes and in some cases the translations of the words. The hymn
books of our time have become the channels through which flow the
rich contributions to the stream of Christian hymnody from Christian
people of all times and places.</p>

<h3 id="sect11">11. Gospel Songs.</h3>
<p>During the latter part of the 19th century there
came into use, both in the United States and in England, a type of religious
song known as the Gospel Song. Less dignified than the chorales
<span class="pb" id="Page_xxvii">xxvii</span>
or the English hymns, these songs made a popular appeal and were
widely used in prayer meetings and revivals.</p>
<p>The words of the typical Gospel Song are usually simple and easily
remembered and concern themselves largely with the individual&rsquo;s salvation.
The personal pronouns &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;my&rdquo; predominate. The tunes
are rhythmic and catchy and always have a refrain added. Their harmonies
are largely built on the simple tonic, dominant, and subdominant
chords. The masses of the people readily learned to sing these
tunes and experienced a thrill in singing them which the use of the
more stately and solid hymns failed to effect.</p>
<p>The great bulk of these songs were produced in America during the
latter half of the 19th century and were found extremely useful in large
mass meetings. The evangelistic work of Moody and Sankey during the
1870&rsquo;s, 1880&rsquo;s, and 1890&rsquo;s brought the Gospel Songs into special prominence
and the Salvation Army has made them known in nearly every
country in the world. Collections of Gospel Songs sold by the millions
of copies and every denomination was affected, to a greater or lesser
extent, by this type of singing.</p>
<p>Since the standard of music and words in the Gospel Songs is considerably
below that which prevails in our best hymnals as well as in
secular music and literature taught in the public schools, churches
should seriously consider the ultimate effect of their too frequent use.
It is a fallacy to assert that the people will respond to nothing better.
Gospel Songs have a legitimate place, particularly in special services and
revivals, but they leave much to be desired in the total work and worship
of the church. Neither the music nor the words possess the strength
and dignity entirely adequate for the worshipful praise of the Eternal.</p>
<p>The principal names associated with Gospel Songs are the following:</p>
<p><i>Authors.</i> Fanny J. Crosby, Philip P. Bliss, Robert Lowry, Katherine
Hankey, E. A. Hoffman, and many others. Most of the words, though
not all, were written by Americans during the latter part of the nineteenth
century. Miss Crosby was by far the most prolific of them all
and many of her works are found in all modern hymnals of denominations
that use this type of music. In Germany, Ernst Gebhardt became
the leader of the gospel song movement, composing words and music,
publishing numerous song books, and serving as song leader in great
revival meetings.</p>
<p><i>Music.</i> William B. Bradbury, Robert Lowry, W. H. Doane, Philip
Philips, James McGranahan, George C. Stebbins, P. P. Bliss, D. W.
Towner, Wm. J. Kirkpatrick, and others.</p>
<p><i>Song Leaders.</i> P. P. Bliss, Ira Sankey, James McGranahan, George C.
Stebbins, Charles Alexander, Homer Rodeheaver.</p>
<p>It should be noted that there is no absolute line of demarcation between
<span class="pb" id="Page_xxviii">xxviii</span>
hymns and some of the Gospel Songs. Some of the numbers in the
Gospel Songs section of the <i>Hymnary</i> might well be classified as hymns,
e.g., Nos. <a href="#hymn_441">441</a>, <a href="#hymn_444">444</a>, <a href="#hymn_447">447</a>, <a href="#hymn_458">458</a>, <a href="#hymn_463">463</a>, <a href="#hymn_468">468</a>, <a href="#hymn_470">470</a>, <a href="#hymn_471">471</a>, <a href="#hymn_472">472</a>, and <a href="#hymn_492">492</a>. Either
words or music meet the generally accepted standards of a hymn.</p>

<h3 id="sect13">13. Mennonite Hymnody.</h3>
<p>Mennonites have made many contributions
to society through their religious life and practices, but we have
produced no important hymnody of our own. Throughout the four hundred
years of our existence as a church, we have been a singing people,
in times of persecution as well as in times of peace. Great emphasis has
always been laid upon the importance of congregational singing in our
worship services. Since the beginning of the 19th century the Mennonites
of various branches, in America alone, have published over fifty
hymnbooks. But an examination of these hymnbooks shows that we are
heavily indebted to others. Instead of producing original hymns and
tunes, we have borrowed, with minor exceptions, our entire repertory
from other denominations. The wealth of verse and music produced by
German and English writers throughout the centuries has been found
to serve our needs adequately and well.</p>
<p>The churches in Europe used hymnbooks compiled from Lutheran
and Reformed sources. Upon coming to the United States and Canada,
they gradually adopted English and American hymns and in some
sections of the church, the Gospel Songs came into wide use.</p>
<p>Our German collections of hymns have, until recently, been uniformly
on a higher level, both as to music and poetry, than the collections
used after the change was made to the English language. During the
transition from the German to the English language, many churches, in
their choice of their hymnbooks, sacrificed the fine chorales which had
been a part of their religious heritage. This was due partly to the
revivalistic influences of the times and partly to the fact that there
were no good translations available of the German hymns which
earlier were in use. The situation is gradually correcting itself. We are
re-evaluating our hymnody, sifting the wheat from the chaff, and bringing
back into our worship the rich treasure of song which had been used
in the past. The <i>Mennonite Hymnary</i> is an effort in this direction.</p>
<h3 id="sect14">14. The Antecedents of the Mennonite Hymnary.</h3>
<p>The story
of the hymn books antedating the <i>Hymnary</i> may be briefly summarized
by listing the following books:</p>
<p class="biblio">1565. The first German Mennonite hymn book was published
<span class="pb" id="Page_xxx">xxx</span>
in 1565 or 1566 (date omitted from title), entitled, <i>Ein
sch&ouml;n Gesangb&uuml;chlein Geistlicher Lieder, zusammengetragen
aus dem A. und N. Testament durch fromme Christen
und Liebhaber Gottes, welcher hief&uuml;r etliche getrucht
sei gewesen, aber noch viel dazu gethan, welche nie im
Truck aussgangen seindt, in welchen auch ein recht Leben
und Fundament dez rechten Christlichen Glaubens gelehrt
wirdt. Coloss. 3.</i></p>
<p class="bibliocont">A second edition, 1570-1583, (date not given), adds to
the above title the following:</p>
<p class="bibliocont"><i>Jetzo von neuem widerum &uuml;bersehn, an vielen Orten gebessert
und mit etlichen newen Liedern vermehret. Coloss. 3.</i></p>
<p class="bibliocont">Of the 133 hymns in the book, 9 had been in use among
other churches. Many of the others were by Mennonite
authors, among them Johann Sch&uuml;tz, Thomas Ducker,
Gerhard Siebenakker von Sittart, and Heinrich Krenen von
Breidtbock. Many of the hymns are of a controversial nature
and have no literary value; for example, this on infant
baptism:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Die Schrift sagt nicht von Kindertaufe</p>
<p class="t0">Davon hab ich nicht gelesen.</p>
<p class="t0">Wer nach Gottes Wort getauft soll sein</p>
<p class="t0">Der musz gl&auml;ubig wesen.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Es ist ein Bad der Wiedergeburt,</p>
<p class="t0">Ein Bund eines guten Gewissens</p>
<p class="t0">Ein&rsquo; Verneurung des heiliges Geistes</p>
<p class="t0">Davon keine Kinder wissen.</p>
</div>
<p class="bibliocont">Most of the hymns were set to secular melodies popular
at the time. Very little of this first hymnal survives.</p>
<p class="biblio">1570&mdash;<i>Ausbund, Das ist: Etliche sch&ouml;ne Christliche Lieder, wie
sie in dem Gef&auml;ngnis zu Passau in dem Schlosz von den
Schweizer-Br&uuml;dern und von andern rechtglaubigen
Christen hin und her gedichtet worden.</i></p>
<p class="bibliocont">At least twelve editions have been printed in Europe, the
last one in Basel, 1838. Its use was confined to the South
Germans and Swiss Mennonites. Reprinted in America
and still in use by the Amish, the <i>Ausbund</i> has the distinction
of being the oldest hymn book officially in use by
any church in America.</p>
<p class="biblio">1780&mdash;<i>Geistreiches Gesangbuch zur &ouml;ffentlichen und besonderen
Erbauung der Mennonitischen Gemeinde in und vor
der Stadt Danzig.</i></p>
<p class="bibliocont">The book has had long use in Danzig. A revised edition
appeared in 1908.</p>
<p class="biblio">1803&mdash;<i>Das Kleine Geistliche Harfe der Kinder Zions.</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_xxxi">xxxi</span>
Germantown, Pa. The first Mennonite hymnbook printed in
America. It was the official hymnbook of the Franconia
Conference of Mennonites of which John H. Oberholzer,
founder of the General Conference of Mennonites, was a
member. Seven editions were printed, the last in Elkhart,
Ind., 1904.</p>
<p class="biblio">1804&mdash;<i>Unpartheyisches Gesangbuch</i>, Lancaster, Pa. The official
hymnbook of the Lancaster Mennonite Conference for almost
a century. Fourteen reprints were made, the last in
1923 for the Amish.</p>
<p class="biblio">1843&mdash;<i>Gesangbuch in welchem eine Sammlung geistreiche Lieder
befindlich.</i> 9th ed. Elbing. The hymnbook of the Prussian
Mennonites. It was taken by the Prussians to Russia
where it was republished in Odessa, 1844.</p>
<p class="biblio">1856&mdash;<i>Gesangbuch zum Gottesdienstlichen und haeuslichen Gebrauch
in Evangelischen Mennoniten Gemeinden.</i> Worms.</p>
<p class="bibliocont">Published by the churches of Baden and the Palatinate.
The hymnal committee was fortunate in securing the assistance
of the eminent German hymnologist, Albert Knapp.
The book contains 600 hymns and an appendix of prayers.
A book of melodies was also provided. This collection
holds an important place in Mennonite hymnody. It was
reprinted in Danzig, 1873, for use by the Danzig Mennonites,
and in Philadelphia, 1873, for use in the General
Conference of Mennonites. The excellent qualities of the
more recent <i>Gesangbuch mit Noten</i> may be traced, in considerable
measure, to this work.</p>
<p class="biblio">1869&mdash;<i>Gesangbuch in Mennoniten Gemeinden f&uuml;r Kirche und
Haus.</i> Published for the churches of West Prussia, this
work went through at least four editions, the fourth in
1901. The book was republished in Danzig, 1873.</p>
<p class="biblio">1873&mdash;<i>Gesangbuch zum Gottesdienstlichen und h&auml;uslichen Gebrauch
in Mennoniten Gemeinden.</i> Philadelphia. Ordered
by the sixth General Conference of Mennonites held
at Wadsworth, Ohio. The main body of the book is the
same as that published in Worms, 1856, but with the appendix
of prayers omitted, and an appendix of 22 hymns
added, the latter the contribution of the Mennonites in
Pennsylvania. The book was intended to form a closer
bond of union between the Mennonites in the East and
those west of the Mississippi.</p>
<p class="biblio">1890&mdash;<i>Gesangbuch mit Noten. Herausgegeben von der allgemeinen
Conferenz der Mennoniten von Nord America.</i>
Berne, Ind. The book passed through 15 editions, the last
in 1936. A noteworthy collection of hymns and tunes that
<span class="pb" id="Page_xxxii">xxxii</span>
met with wide approval in the General Conference
churches.</p>
<p class="biblio">1894&mdash;<i>Mennonite Hymnal, A Blending of Many Voices.</i> Berne,
Ind. An A. S. Barnes publication adopted, practically unchanged,
by the General Conference of Mennonites. Our
first official English hymnal, though many collections from
other sources were finding wide use in our churches. The
book has nothing of distinctiveness or distinction.</p>
<p class="biblio">1927&mdash;<i>The Mennonite Hymn Book.</i> Berne, Ind. Published
by the General Conference of Mennonites. Compiled and
edited by a committee appointed by the Conference. The
book was more satisfactory than the <i>Mennonite Hymnal</i>
of 1894, but never became very popular. Total sales of
three editions were less than 5,000 copies.</p>
<p class="biblio">1940&mdash;<i>The Mennonite Hymnary.</i> Published by the General
Conference of Mennonites of North America, Board of
Publication, Mennonite Publication Office, Newton, Kansas,
1940. Now in its sixth edition.</p>
<h3 id="sect15">15. The Translation of Hymns.</h3>
<p>A word may be in order concerning
the translation of hymns. It is difficult to transfer the color and
feeling of one language to another. For this reason many people who
know the German hymns by heart have a sense of disappointment when
they read them in an English version. In some instances a translation is
inferior to the original but this is not necessarily the case. It is well
to remember that nearly all of us read the Bible only in a translation,
yet never doubt the literary quality of the English King James Version
or the German Version of Luther. The hymn, &ldquo;Ich weiss einen Strom,&rdquo;
is superior as poetry, and in its religious feeling, to the English original,
&ldquo;O have you not heard of that beautiful stream,&rdquo; though the former is
a translation of the latter. The reason is that Gebhardt, the translator,
was a poet in his own right. Good translations are possible if the
translator has poetic ability of a high order, and if he translates into
his native tongue. Catherine Winkworth was the foremost translator
of German hymns into English and Ernst Gebhardt performed a similar
role in translating English and American hymns into German. Had
either tried to do the work of the other, the results would in all probability
have lacked true color and correct idiomatic and poetic expression.</p>
<h3 id="sect16">16. Church Unity in the Hymnbook.</h3>
<p>The unity of the Christian
Church is expressed nowhere more eloquently than in the hymns we
sing. Every modern hymnal, regardless of the denominational interest
<span class="pb" id="Page_xxxiii">xxxiii</span>
it represents, reaches across the ages to gather its treasures from sources
new and old; it knows nothing of the external barriers which divide
Christians into denominations, but makes use of the hymns of widely
divergent Christian groups. The <i>Mennonite Hymnary</i> is no exception.
Here are found hymns from the early church, East and West, translated
from the Greek and Latin fathers. Others, like Savonarola&rsquo;s hymn, come
from the Middle Ages. Many are chorales from the land of Luther, or
metrical psalms from the Calvinistic reformers. A substantial body of
our hymnody stems from the Anglican Church, while some of our best
hymns are from sturdy independents like Watts and Doddridge, and
still others breathe the evangelistic fervor of Wesley, Cowper, and
Newton. The Quakers too have made their contribution as well as
certain Roman Catholics and Unitarians. In no aspect of our church life
do we attain so nearly to ecumenicity as in our worship in song. Christians
may differ widely in their religious views but they are able to
unite as one body in singing their songs of praise.</p>
<p>The following classification of hymns by denominations is far from
exhaustive. It is intended merely to suggest the wealth of material
drawn from many denominations, listing only representative writers
together with a representative hymn. The <a href="#c8">index of authors</a> may be

<h3 id="sect17">17. Hymn Meters.</h3>
<p>Meter (English, <i>Metre</i>) refers to the rhythmic
element in poetry:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>a. the number of lines in a stanza.</dt>
<dt>b. the number of syllables in a line.</dt>
<dt>c. the arrangement of accented and unaccented syllables.</dt></dl>
<p>The figures attached to the tune names in the <i>Hymnary</i> indicate the
number of lines in a stanza and the number of syllables in a line, e. g.,
8.7.8.7. means that the hymn has four lines in each stanza, the first line
being made up of 8 syllables, the second of 7 syllables, the third of 8
syllables, and the last of 7 syllables. The figures are placed there to
facilitate the fitting of tunes to hymns, a responsibility which is left now-a-days
largely to hymnbook editors.</p>
<p>A given tune may be used with any variety of hymns provided the
latter have the same meter as the tune. Likewise a given hymn may be
sung to any tune that fits its meter, e.g., &ldquo;Come, Thou Almighty King,&rdquo;
set to the tune, &ldquo;Italian Hymn,&rdquo; as both have the meter pattern
6.6.4.6.6.6.4. This is also the meter of &ldquo;My country &rsquo;tis of thee&rdquo; set to
&ldquo;America.&rdquo; Hence the words and tunes of these hymns may be interchanged.
As a matter of fact, &ldquo;Come Thou Almighty King&rdquo; was originally
used with the tune &ldquo;America.&rdquo; The practice of using alternate
tunes is less common now than formerly and must be done with care
for while the meters may be suited, the words and tune may be incompatible
otherwise.</p>
<h5>Meter Names</h5>
<p>A few meters have specific names. These, with their abbreviations
are as follows:</p>
<p><i>Short Meter</i> (S.M.) 6.6.8.6, e.g.</p>
<table class="center" summary="">
<tr><td class="l">Blest be the tie that binds </td><td class="l">(6)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l"><span class="hst">Our hearts in Christian love:</span> </td><td class="l">(6)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">The fellowship of kindred minds </td><td class="l">(8)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l"><span class="hst">Is like to that above.</span> </td><td class="l">(6)</td></tr>
</table>
<p><i>Short Meter Double</i> (S.M.D.) is used for a tune in which the quatrain
is repeated, e.g. &ldquo;Terra Beata&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_48">48</a>), set to the words &ldquo;This is my
Father&rsquo;s world.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Common Meter</i> (C.M.), also called Ballad Meter, consists of four
lines of 8.6.8.6. syllables, e.g.</p>
<table class="center" summary="">
<tr><td class="l">In Christ there is no East or West </td><td class="l">(8)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l"><span class="hst">In Him no South or North;</span> </td><td class="l">(6)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">But one great fellowship of love </td><td class="l">(8)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l"><span class="hst">Throughout the whole wide earth.</span> </td><td class="l">(6)</td></tr>
</table>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xxxvii">xxxvii</div>
<p>Nearly all the metrical psalms appeared in this meter.</p>
<p><i>Common Meter Double</i> (C.M.D.) is employed when two Common
Meter quatrains are used to form one stanza, e.g.,</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;It came upon a midnight clear.&rdquo;<span class="hst"> (<a href="#hymn_75">75</a>)</span></p>
<p><i>Long Meter</i> (L.M.) consists of a four line stanza in which each line
is of eight syllables, e.g.,</p>
<table class="center" summary="">
<tr><td class="l">Praise God, from whom all blessings flow; </td><td class="l">(8)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Praise Him, all creatures here below; </td><td class="l">(8)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Praise Him above, ye heavenly host; </td><td class="l">(8)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. </td><td class="l">(8)</td></tr>
</table>
<p><i>Long Meter Double</i> (L.M.D.), not often used, consists of a stanza
of eight lines, each line of eight syllables, e.g.,</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;The spacious firmament on high.&rdquo;<span class="hst"> (<a href="#hymn_50">50</a>)</span></p>
<h5>Accentuation</h5>
<p>In setting a hymn to music it is important that the accented syllables
of the poetry fall on the accented beats of the musical bars. Try singing
&ldquo;Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_456">456</a>) to the tune &ldquo;Ich weiss einen
Strom&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_232">232</a>). The meter is the same in each case&mdash;11.7.11.7.&mdash;with refrain&mdash;but
the words and tune are obviously not suited to each other
because of differences in accentuation.</p>

<dt><a href="#sect23">d. Sources of tunes.</a></dt>
<dt><a href="#sect24">e. Tune names.</a></dt></dl>
<h3 id="sect20">a. What is a good tune?</h3>
<p>The quality of a tune must be judged by its
definite and restricted use. It is to be sung by a congregation of people,
the majority of whom have had only limited musical training, and
without benefit of rehearsal. The tune must therefore be judged by
such questions as these: Is it singable? Are the parts within easy pitch
range of the voices? Is it free from difficult intervals or modulations into
other keys? Is it interesting? Does it create a worshipful atmosphere?
Does the mood of the tune fit the mood and thought of the words?</p>
<h3 id="sect21">b. The importance of tunes.</h3>
<p>The tune is of great importance to the
success of the hymn. Our &ldquo;best hymns&rdquo; owe their popularity in many
instances, to the tune with which they are associated. On the other hand
many excellent hymns remain unused because the tunes given them are
too difficult or too uninteresting. It is the tune that creates the mood
of worship and charges the words with emotion so that their message
is carried forth with feeling and power.</p>
<h3 id="sect22">c. Composers of tunes.</h3>
<p>The story of the development of the hymn
tune begins with the worship song in the Temple at Jerusalem where
the psalms were sung antiphonally by priests and people accompanied
<span class="pb" id="Page_xxxviii">xxxviii</span>
by harps and trumpets. Little is known of these tunes or their composers.
This early Christian music would doubtless sound strange to
modern ears.</p>
<p>The important names in the roll of church musicians, from the early
centuries to the present time, include the following:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt><i>Italian</i>&mdash;Ambrose, 4th century</dt>
<dd class="t">Gregory the Great, 6th century</dd>
<dd class="t">Palestrina, 1525-94</dd>
<dt><i>French</i>&mdash;Louis Bourgeois, c. 1510-?</dt>
<dt><i>German</i>&mdash;Luther, 1483-1546; Nicolai, 1556-1608; Hassler, 1564-1612; Praetorius, 1571-1621; Cr&uuml;ger, 1598-1662; Bach, 1685-1750.</dt>
<dt><i>English</i>&mdash;Tallis, 1510-85; Gibbons, 1583-1625; Croft, 1678-1727; Gauntlett, 1805-76; Monk, 1823-99; Dykes, 1823-76; S. Wesley, 1810-76; Barnby, 1838-96; Stainer, 1840-1901; Sullivan, 1842-1900.</dt>
<dt><i>American</i>&mdash;L. Mason, 1792-1872; Bradbury, 1816-68; Hastings, 1784-1872; Stebbins, 1846-1945.</dt></dl>
<p>The great composers, besides Bach, whose names are found in church
hymnals are: Haydn, Beethoven, Handel, Mozart, Mendelssohn, Gounod,
and Sibelius.</p>
<p>The above is only a partial list of composers of good church music.
Among their works is a corpus of fine hymn tunes far greater than has
been utilized by the church so far. For years to come, compilers of hymn
books will have a vast reservoir of excellent tunes, old yet new, to draw
from.</p>
<h3 id="sect23">d. Sources of tunes.</h3>
<p>An examination of the origin of church tunes
shows a variety of sources. Many tunes were especially written for
the words to which they are set; others are adaptations from early
medieval chants; still others, as for example, the &ldquo;Passion Chorale&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Londonderry Air&rdquo;, were folk tunes originally used with secular words.
Some of our best tunes are adaptations of melodies from larger musical
works, as for example, &ldquo;Hymn to Joy&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_10">10</a>) from Beethoven&rsquo;s <i>Ninth
Symphony</i>; &ldquo;Finlandia&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_54">54</a>), from a tone poem by Sibelius; and
&ldquo;Seymour&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_36">36</a>), from Weber&rsquo;s opera, <i>Oberon</i>.</p>
<h3 id="sect24">e. Tune names.</h3>
<p>Composers usually name their tunes in order to facilitate
their identification. The names given them are selected quite
arbitrarily. W. H. Havergal, prolific composer of church music, named
his tunes after the rivers, mountains, valleys, etc., of Palestine, e.g.
&ldquo;Abana,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ahava,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ararat,&rdquo; &ldquo;Baca,&rdquo; etc. Other tunes have been named
for the composer, e.g., &ldquo;Bradbury&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_395">395</a>); the name of a friend, e.g.,
&ldquo;Rockingham&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_105">105</a>); name of a city or village, e.g., &ldquo;Boylston&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_214">214</a>);
a street, &ldquo;Federal Street&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_192">192</a>); a cottage, &ldquo;Hollingside&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_159">159</a>); an
event in history, &ldquo;Nicaea&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_1">1</a>); or the central idea in the words, &ldquo;Pilot&rdquo;
(<a href="#hymn_161">161</a>).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xxxix">xxxix</div>
<p>In Germany, the usual practice has been to name the tune after the
first line of the hymn to which it was originally set.</p>
<p>Some tunes, unfortunately, are known by more than one name, e.g.,
&ldquo;St. Michel&rsquo;s&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_93">93</a>) and &ldquo;Jerusalem, Jerusalem&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_125">125</a>). In a few cases
the same name is given to several tunes, e.g., &ldquo;Wesley&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_309">309</a> and <a href="#hymn_332">332</a>).
This is confusing and it is highly desirable that hymnbook editors strive
toward uniformity of nomenclature.</p>
<h3 id="sect25"><a id="sect19">19.</a> John Wesley&rsquo;s Rules for Singing.</h3>
<p>In one of John Wesley&rsquo;s
compilations of tunes, <i>Sacred Melody</i>, the great preacher and founder of
Methodism gives the following rules for singing. Some of the expressions
used may provoke a smile but, as Lightwood suggests, &ldquo;it would be
a very good thing if these were read aloud from time to time in all
churches and chapels where good congregational singing is aimed at.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. Learn these tunes before you learn any others; afterwards
learn as many as you please.</p>
<p>b. Sing them exactly as they are printed here, without altering
or mending them at all; and if you have learned to sing them
otherwise, unlearn it as soon as you can.</p>
<p>c. Sing ALL. See that you join with the congregation as frequently
as you can. Let not a slight degree of weakness or
weariness hinder you. If it is a cross to you, take it up, and
you will find it a blessing.</p>
<p>d. Sing lustily and with a good courage. Beware of singing as if
you were half dead, or half asleep; but lift up your voice
with strength. Be no more afraid of your voice now, nor
more ashamed of its being heard, than when you sang the
songs of Satan.</p>
<p>e. Sing modestly. Do not bawl, so as to be heard above or distinct
from the rest of the congregation, that you may not
destroy the harmony; but strive to unite your voices together,
so as to make one clear melodious sound.</p>
<p>f. Sing in tune. Whatever time is sung be sure to keep with
it. Do not run before nor stay behind it; but attend close to
the leading voices, and move therewith exactly as you can;
and take care not to sing too low. This drawling way naturally
steals on all who are lazy: and it is high time to drive
it out from among us, and sing all our tunes just as quick as
we did at first.</p>
<p>g. Above all sing spiritually. Have an eye to God in every
word you sing. Aim at pleasing Him more than yourself, or
any other creature. In order to do this attend strictly to the
sense of what you sing, and see that your heart is not carried
away with the sound, but offered to God continually; so shall
our singing be such as the Lord will approve of here, and
regard you when He cometh in the clouds of Heaven.</p>

<h4 class="b">WORSHIP&mdash;PRAISE AND ADORATION</h4>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_1">1. Holy, holy, holy</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Reginald Heber</i>, 1783-1826</div>
<p>A metrical paraphrase of Revelation 4:8-11. The hymn was written
for use on Trinity Sunday of the Church Year but has found a wide
general use as a morning hymn. It ranks high in any list of &ldquo;best
hymns.&rdquo; Some give it first place.</p>
<p>The author, Reginald Heber, was educated at Oxford, England, for
the Anglican ministry. For sixteen years he served as rector at Hodnet,
Shropshire, where most of his hymns were written. He became an eminent
churchman, as well as hymn writer, and was made bishop of Calcutta
in 1822. After four years, his life came to an end suddenly at the
close of a day in which he had baptized forty-two native converts. He
is the author of the popular missionary hymn, &ldquo;From Greenland&rsquo;s icy
mountains&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_333">333</a>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy, holy, holy,&rdquo; was one of Alfred Tennyson&rsquo;s favorite hymns,
and it was sung at his funeral service in Westminster Abbey, April 12,
1892.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> The tune, <span class="small">NICAEA</span>, was composed for this hymn and was
so named because the text deals with the doctrine of the Trinity as
expounded in the Council of Nicaea which met in the city of Nicaea in
Asia Minor, 325 A.D., the first ecumenical council of the Christian
Church. It convened at the call of the Emperor, Constantine, to settle
the so-called &ldquo;Arian controversy&rdquo; concerning the nature of Christ.
Arius, a presbyter of Alexandria, taught that Christ was neither divine
nor human, but superangelic. After sitting from May 20 to August 25,
to hear all sides of the heated debate, the council decided in favor of
Athanasius, a deacon of Alexandria and chief opponent of Arius. The
result was incorporated in the Nicene creed which declares that Christ
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
is &ldquo;the same substance with the Father.&rdquo; Our hymn asserts the
same doctrine: &ldquo;God in Three Persons, blessed Trinity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>J. B. Dykes, 1823-76, composer of the tune, was born in Hull, England,
the son of a banker. He was educated at Cambridge for the ministry
but had also received a thorough training in music and became one
of England&rsquo;s leading hymn-tune writers. For a score of years he was
vicar of the Anglican church, St. Oswald&rsquo;s, in the city of Durham. He
published sermons and other writings but is best known for his 300
hymn tunes, many of which are still in wide use. One of his most
popular tunes is &ldquo;Lux Benigna&rdquo; which is always associated with John
Henry Newman&rsquo;s hymn, &ldquo;Lead kindly light&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_162">162</a>).</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_2">2. God is in His holy temple</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Anonymous</i></div>
<p>Based on Hab. 2:20: &ldquo;The Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth
keep silence before him.&rdquo; The hymn, whose authorship is anonymous,
is a call to silence and reverence as the worshipper bows in the presence
of God.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> The origin of the popular and useful tune, <span class="small">AUTUMN</span>, has
been in dispute. Some books refer to it as a Spanish melody, and others
have seen in the tune a reminiscence of a psalm-tune found in the
<i>Genevan Psalter</i> of 1551. It is ascribed here to one, Louis von Esch,
but Dr. Robert McCutchan, editor of the <i>Methodist Hymnal</i> and author
of <i>Our Hymnody</i>, says: &ldquo;There is no basis whatever for ascribing it to
any other than Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francois H. Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mon was born in Bordeaux, July 27, 1741, and
died in London, July 20, 1808. He gave up his position as an officer in
the French army to make music his profession and became a composer
and distinguished violinist and conductor in England. Most of his
compositions were of a secular nature. His other church pieces are
&ldquo;Morning Hymn&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_25">25</a>) and &ldquo;Ballerma&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_146">146</a>, <a href="#hymn_585">585</a>). Late in life Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mon
joined the Swedenborgian Church. He died of paralysis at
the age of 67.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_3">3, 4, 5. All <a id="hymn_5">hail</a> <a id="hymn_4">the</a> power of Jesus&rsquo; name</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Edward Perronet</i>, 1726-92</div>
<p>The original version of this hymn contained eight stanzas and first
appeared in the <i>Gospel Magazine</i>, Augustus Toplady&rsquo;s journal, the
first stanza together with the tune &ldquo;Miles Lane,&rdquo; in November, 1779,
and the remaining stanzas in April, 1780. It is one of the popular,
stirring hymns of the English language, sung in England almost invariably
to the tune &ldquo;Miles Lane&rdquo; and in America more generally to
&ldquo;Coronation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>Edward Perronet was born in 1726 and became a vicar in the Church
of England in Shoreham. Later, under the influence of John Wesley,
he left the established church to become an itinerant Methodist preacher.
After some years he left the Methodists and ministered to a small
dissenting congregation in Canterbury, where he died in 1792.</p>
<p>The fourth stanza is attributed by some authorities to the Rev. John
Rippon, a Baptist minister.</p>
<p>A missionary in India, E. P. Scott, went to visit a mountain tribe
when one day he found himself surrounded with a number of wild,
ferocious tribesmen, pointing their spears at him. Expecting death,
he closed his eyes and sang this hymn, &ldquo;All hail the power of Jesus&rsquo;
name,&rdquo; playing the tune &ldquo;Miles Lane&rdquo; on his violin. The music and
words produced such a profound effect upon these wild tribesmen that
they spared Scott&rsquo;s life and invited him to settle among them. For over
two years, until his health failed, he worked with great success among
them, and when he was compelled to return to America, they accompanied
him thirty or forty miles and begged him to return. Upon regaining
his health, he did return and labored with them until his death.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">MILES LANE</span> (<a href="#hymn_3">No. 3</a>) was composed by William Shrubsole,
1760-1806, especially for this hymn. He was an intimate friend of
the author of the hymn. Most of his life was spent as music teacher
and organist in various English churches. The tune is very effective,
especially in its thrilling climax in the fourfold repetition of &ldquo;Crown
Him.&rdquo; However, due to its wide melodic range, its sustained notes, and
interrupted pace, it is more difficult to sing than &ldquo;Coronation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="small">CORONATION</span> (<a href="#hymn_4">No. 4</a>) was composed by Oliver Holden. He had
little formal training in music and was a carpenter by trade. He was
born in Shirley, Mass., Sept. 18, 1765. After the English burned
Charlestown, across the river from Boston, Holden helped in the task
of rebuilding and made considerable money. Later he engaged in the
real estate business, owned a music store, and all the while led choirs
and singing schools. He was elected representative to the Congress. He
was an influential citizen and a prominent member of the Baptist
Church. However, he is remembered by posterity as the composer of
this much-loved tune.</p>
<p><span class="small">DIADEM</span> (<a href="#hymn_5">No. 5</a>) is an effective tune widely used on anniversary occasions.
The composer, James Ellor, an English Methodist, was born in
Lancashire in 1819. He was not a professional musician, but a hatter
by trade. For a time he worked as a railway employee. While still a
young man, he came to America, where he worked at the hatmaking
trade. For some years before his death in 1899, he was nearly blind.
This tune was composed when Ellor was only 19 years old. It was written
especially for this hymn and has had wide use as a choir number.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_6">6. Ye servants of God, your Master proclaim</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Charles Wesley</i>, 1707-88</div>
<p>This hymn by Charles Wesley, perhaps the greatest hymnist of all
ages, was No. 1 in a collection published in 1774 and entitled, <i>Hymns
for Times of Trouble and Persecution</i>. The original had six stanzas
and was marked, &ldquo;To be sung in a tumult.&rdquo; The Wesleys knew the
meaning of persecution and tumults. They were often attacked by godless
men who used physical violence. Hoodlums were known to try to
break up their meetings by blowing horns, ringing bells, or barking in
front of the preacher. Sometimes cattle were driven into the congregation.
The Wesleys were also opposed by the clergy and people of the
established church who hated the upheavals and disturbances these men
caused in the staid and stolid church life of the times. Nothing could
stop the Wesleys or repress their enthusiasm. John, who once thanked
God for getting together such a &ldquo;congregation of drunkards, swearers,
and Sabbath breakers,&rdquo; continued his preaching; and Charles his hymn
writing. With the early apostles, the Wesleys could say, &ldquo;We cannot but
speak the things which we have seen and heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles Wesley, John&rsquo;s youngest brother, graduated from Oxford in
1729 and became a devout priest in the Anglican Church. He came to
Georgia in 1735 as secretary to General Oglethorpe but after one year,
he returned to England on account of failing health. The years from
1738 to 1756 were devoted whole heartedly to assisting his brother John
in the great revivalistic work among the masses of the common people
in England, Scotland, and Ireland. He was a prolific writer, being the
author of about 6,500 hymns. Of these only a few score survive, so difficult
is it to write hymns that stand the test of time. Twenty-three of his
hymns, more than of any other author, are included in the <i>Hymnary</i>.
Wesley, being Arminian in his theology (as opposed to the predestinarian
views of Calvinism) emphasizes in his hymns the power of
Christ to save to the uttermost. Others of his hymns surpass this one
from the standpoint of good literature, but very few equal its spirit of
adoring praise and fervid enthusiasm.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">HANOVER</span> is a vigorous, singable, hymn-tune which has
long been associated with these words, although the tune &ldquo;Lyons&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_7">7</a>),
too, is frequently set to this hymn. It is one of the earliest examples of
the English psalm-tune, as distinguished from the Genevan. The triple
measure was novel and met with objection when it first appeared.</p>
<p>The composer, William Croft, 1678-1727, had a doctor&rsquo;s degree in
music and was organist, for a time, in Westminster Abbey, London,
where his remains lie buried. He labored hard, amidst many discouragements,
to improve the music in the Church of England, and made for
himself in the field of sacred music, one of the greatest names in English
musical history. His tunes and anthems are widely used.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_7">7. O worship the King, all glorious above</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Robert Grant</i>, 1779-1838</div>
<p>A simple, yet majestic hymn, based on the magnificent 104th Psalm.
A careful reading of the Psalm will result in a new appreciation of this
free paraphrase by Grant.</p>
<p>Robert Grant was born in Bombay, India. When six years old, his
parents moved to London. He received his education in Oxford, was
admitted to the bar, elected to Parliament in 1808, and then held various
responsible government positions, climaxed in 1834 by his appointment
as Governor of Bombay. He died at Delpoonie, India, where a
medical school, bearing his name, was erected in his memory. Though
a prominent man and active in public affairs, Grant will be remembered
principally as the author of this, his most important hymn. He wrote
a number of other hymns but only this one and &ldquo;Savior, when, in dust,
to Thee&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_145">145</a>) have survived.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> The tune <span class="small">LYONS</span> is by Haydn, not the famous &ldquo;Papa&rdquo;
Haydn who wrote symphonies, string quartets, and <i>The Creation</i>, but
J. Michael Haydn, 1737-1806, a younger brother. He was born in
Austria. Though self-taught in music (like his famous brother Franz),
he became the teacher of many eminent musicians of his time, including
Carl von Weber. Haydn was a warm-hearted, devout, and gifted
man, and might have become famous except for two things&mdash;his life
was lived in the shadow of his more illustrious brother, and he was too
modest to permit most of his works to be published.</p>
<p><span class="small">LYONS</span> is a singable tune with a fine melodic curve and is strikingly
similar to &ldquo;Hanover&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_6">6</a>) with which it may be interchanged with good
effect.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_8">8. Come Thou Almighty King</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Charles Wesley</i>, 1707-88</div>
<p>This hymn of praise and prayer is widely used in all branches of
the Christian church in the English speaking world and has been translated
into many foreign languages. It has been generally attributed to
Charles Wesley, the great &ldquo;Bard of Methodism,&rdquo; but the authorship is
uncertain. The hymn appeared as the first of only two selections in a
small booklet published by John Wesley about 1757. The second hymn
was by Charles Wesley and was entitled, &ldquo;The Backslider.&rdquo; &ldquo;Come,
Thou Almighty King,&rdquo; with the title, &ldquo;An Hymn to the Trinity,&rdquo; did
not bear the name of Charles Wesley, and it appears nowhere in his
collected works. No one can be certain, therefore, of the authorship or
date of its writing. Like all good hymns, it rises above time or personal
circumstance and expresses for all Christians their feeling of praise and
adoration of God. It was originally sung to the tune, &ldquo;God Save the
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
King,&rdquo; the hymn following the same metrical pattern as the British
National Anthem and our own &ldquo;America.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ITALIAN HYMN</span>, also called &ldquo;Trinity,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Moscow,&rdquo; is one
of our most famous hymn tunes and deserves its renown. It was
composed for this hymn by Felice de Giardini, 1716-1796, an Italian
violinist, who spent many years in England and ranked among the top-notch
artists and teachers of violin in Europe. Though a great artist, he
was a capricious and peevish personality, had few friends and many
enemies, was a poor business manager, and died in poverty and distress
in the city of Moscow where he had gone to better his fortune and
failed.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_9">9. Christ is our Cornerstone</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Latin, 8th century</i></div>
<div class="author"><i>Tr. John Chandler</i>, 1806-76</div>
<p>This is a translation of a mediaeval Latin hymn. At the beginning
of the Christian era, the prevailing language was Greek. With the
dominance of Rome over the empire of Alexander the Great, Greek
gradually gave way to the Latin tongue, and from the fourth century
to the dawn of the Reformation, a rich treasury of Latin hymns came
into existence in the church. Many of these have now been translated
for use in modern English speaking churches. They are stately, reverent,
devout pieces of devotional literature which have been the joy and
consolation of countless saintly souls down through the centuries.
Other examples of hymns from Latin sources are found at Nos. <a href="#hymn_67">67</a>, <a href="#hymn_80">80</a>,
<a href="#hymn_87">87</a>, <a href="#hymn_114">114</a>, <a href="#hymn_116">116</a>, <a href="#hymn_171">171</a>, <a href="#hymn_277">277</a>, <a href="#hymn_382">382</a>, and <a href="#hymn_415">415</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christ is our Cornerstone&rdquo; is based on &ldquo;<i>Angularis fundamentum</i>,&rdquo;
a dedication hymn of anonymous authorship, attributed here to the
8th century, but it may be of much earlier origin. <a href="#hymn_277">Hymn 277</a>,
&ldquo;Christ is made the sure foundation,&rdquo; is another rendering of the same
Latin poem, by a different translator and into a different meter, and
is there dated &ldquo;6th or 7th century.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Chandler, the translator, was one of a group of Anglican clergymen
belonging to what was known in England as the Oxford Group
(not to be confused with the recent Oxford group movement headed by
John Buchman). They were interested in restoring to the church a dignified
service of worship. These Latin hymns contributed to this purpose.
Chandler was a scholar as well as preacher, author of several
books and many printed sermons and tracts, and was one of the first
and best translators of Latin hymns. This, of course, is not a literal
translation, for consideration had to be given to poetic and doctrinal
fitness for modern use.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> The tune <span class="small">DARWALL</span> was composed by John Darwall, 1731-89,
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
an Anglican clergyman and also an enthusiastic amateur musician.
He composed a tune for each of the 150 metrical Psalms, each
written in two parts only, treble and bass. <span class="small">DARWALL</span> was set to Psalm
148. His tunes, for the most part, have not been published and have
passed into oblivion.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_10">10. Joyful, joyful we adore Thee</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Henry van Dyke</i>, 1852-1933</div>
<p>A nature hymn of the first order, written by one who himself had
a profound appreciation and love of the out-of-doors. The words from
beginning to end are an expression of the beauty in nature and the resulting
joy and spirit of praise it brings to the worshipper. The hymn
was written in 1907 while the author was on a preaching visit to Williams
College; it was designated to be sung to the &ldquo;Hymn to Joy&rdquo; in
the last movement of Beethoven&rsquo;s <i>Ninth Symphony</i>. The words fit the
music perfectly. It is one of the most joyful hymns in the English
language.</p>
<p>Henry van Dyke was born in Germantown, Pa.; received his education
in Princeton University and Theological Seminary; and began his
work as pastor of the United Congregational Church in Newport, R. I.
After four years he was called to the pulpit of the Brick Presbyterian
Church in New York where he became a widely known figure. In 1900
he was called to the chair of English Literature in Princeton. He was
a friend of President Woodrow Wilson who appointed van Dyke as
minister to the Netherlands and Luxemburg, which post he held from
1913 to 1917. He is the author of many books, including the beautiful
story entitled, <i>The Other Wise Man.</i></p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">HYMN TO JOY</span> is a hymn tune arrangement from the
fourth movement of Beethoven&rsquo;s <i>Ninth Symphony</i>, probably the greatest
symphony ever penned, even though the composer was stone-deaf
when he wrote it.</p>
<p>Ludwig von Beethoven was born at Bonn, Germany, in 1770 and
died in Vienna in 1827. During his tempestuous life, he composed
many compositions for piano, violin, orchestra, and string quartet. His
nine symphonies are on the repertoire of all the great modern symphony
orchestras.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_11">11. Give to our God immortal praise</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Isaac Watts</i>, 1674-1748</div>
<p>Recognized as the best of three versions which Watts made of Psalm
136. The hymn expresses with dignity and fervor the high praise of
God.</p>
<p>Isaac Watts, scholar, poet, and pastor of the Independent Church in
Mark Lane, London, ranks among the greatest of English hymn writers.
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
He is the author of about 600 hymns and versions, many of which are
still in common use. The <i>Hymnary</i> contains 19 of his works. Watts is
often referred to as the &ldquo;father of English hymnody.&rdquo; Though suffering
from bodily ailments during the greater part of his adult life, he was
robust in his thinking and became a bold and sturdy fighter for the
cause of intellectual and religious freedom. Watts was one of the
gentlest and kindest of men and a friend of the young. His wide intellectual
interests enabled him to write textbooks on logic, geography,
and astronomy, which were used in the universities of England as well
as Harvard and Yale. Though he was never married and had no children
of his own, Watts was a lover of children and wrote one of the
world&rsquo;s most beautiful cradle songs&mdash;&ldquo;Hush, my dear, lie still and
slumber.&rdquo; In 1715, he issued a notable book of verse for children.
One of the poems, entitled, &ldquo;Against Quarrelling and Fighting,&rdquo; runs
as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Let dogs delight to bark and bite</p>
<p class="t">For God hath made them so;</p>
<p class="t0">Let bears and lions growl and fight</p>
<p class="t">For &rsquo;tis their nature to.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But children, you should never let</p>
<p class="t">Such angry passions rise;</p>
<p class="t0">Your little hands were never made</p>
<p class="t">To tear each other&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
</div>
<p>Let grown-ups in our day grasp the idea in this simple poem!</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> The tune, <span class="small">LASST UNS ERFREUEN</span>, one of the most famous
in any hymn book, was published in <i>Geistliche Kirchenges&auml;ng</i>, Cologne,
1623. It was set to an Easter hymn beginning, &ldquo;<i>Lasst uns erfreuen
herzlich sehr</i>,&rdquo; from whence it derives its name. The tune is unusual
for its simplicity of structure and its invariable repetition of
phrases throughout. Usually the alleluias in lines 3 and 6 are sung in
harmony, the rest of the song in unison. The tune lends itself well to
antiphonal or echo singing on the rare occasions when such varied effects
are desired. The composer is not known.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_12">12. O for a thousand tongues to sing</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Charles Wesley</i>, 1707-88</div>
<p>From a poem of 18 stanzas, written by Wesley to celebrate the first
anniversary of his great spiritual change, a conversion experience in
which he felt the clear light of the Gospel possessing his soul. The
poem was entitled, &ldquo;For the Anniversary Day of One&rsquo;s Conversion.&rdquo;
Wesley was greatly influenced by the Moravian missionary Peter Bohler
who once said to him: &ldquo;Had I a thousand tongues, I would praise Him
with them all.&rdquo; The incident, lingering in Wesley&rsquo;s mind, was turned
into a song which expresses the joy and confidence of the redeemed.
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
For 150 years, and until recently, this hymn appeared as No. 1 in
Methodist hymnbooks on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">AZMON</span> was introduced into this country from Germany
where it was a favorite school song. Carl G. Gl&auml;ser, the composer, was
born at Weissenfels, Germany, 1784, and died at Barmen, 1829. He
was a teacher of piano, violin, and voice, and director of choruses. He
also owned and managed a music store.</p>
<p>Lowell Mason, the arranger of the tune, was one of America&rsquo;s earliest
exponents and teachers of public school music and did much to
bring worthy popular hymn tunes into the churches. He was born
January 8, 1792, at Orange, N. J. At the age of 16, he was a choir
leader and teacher of singing classes. At 23, he went to Savannah, Ga.,
as a bank clerk, returning to Boston in 1827 to become president and
conductor of the Handel and Haydn Society. He wrote a large number
of singable hymn tunes which have had wide use in the hymn books
of all denominations. More of his compositions are found in the
<i>Hymnary</i> than of any other composer. He died at Orange, N. J.,
August 11, 1872.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_13">13. Great God, the followers of Thy Son</h3>

<p>The author, Henry Ware, Jr., was born at Hingham, Mass., April
21, 1794; died September 25, 1843, at Framingham, Mass. He was
educated at Harvard, and served as minister of the Second Unitarian
Church, Boston, 1817 to 1829, with Ralph Waldo Emerson as assistant
for a time. From 1829 to 1842, he was Professor of Pulpit Eloquence
and Pastoral Care in the Harvard Divinity School. He was editor of

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_14">14. The God of Abraham praise</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Daniel Ben Judah, 14th century</i></div>
<div class="author"><i>Revised version by Thomas Olivers</i>, 1725-99</div>
<p>This praise hymn, with its magnificent tune, had its origin in a Jewish
synagogue in London. Thomas Olivers, a Welshman and follower
of John Wesley, spent fifty years of his life as a Methodist minister, during
which time he travelled more than 100,000 miles on horseback in
his evangelistic work. His fame, however, rests upon this hymn. While
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
visiting in London, he went to the Great Synagogue in Duke&rsquo;s Place
and heard the cantor sing the Hebrew <i>Yigdal</i> or doxology, in which the
articles of the Jewish faith are recited. Upon hearing this, Oliver wrote
&ldquo;The God of Abraham praise,&rdquo; a Christian version of the <i>Yigdal</i>. The
original is by Daniel Ben Judah of the 14th century. Oliver then
called on the Cantor, Meyer Leoni, who gave him this melody to suit
the hymn he had written.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">LEONI</span>, according to Winfield Douglas, is probably not
older than the 17th century and is not related to ancient Jewish
music. Although written in a minor key, it strikes the note of praise.
Its rhythm and vigor of movement adapts it well for use as a processional
or recessional hymn.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_15">15. We praise Thee, O God, our Redeemer</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Julia Bulkley Cady Cory</i></div>
<p>A notable hymn of praise written by Mrs. Julia Cady Cory, who was
born and reared in what was reputed to be one of the happiest Christian
homes in New York City. Her father, J. Cleveland Cady, was a
nationally known architect. A devout Christian, he had a genuine love
for boys and girls and was superintendent of the same Sunday school
for fifty-two years. Concerning the origin of this hymn, Mrs. Cory has
written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Years before I was married (in 1902), the organist of the
Brick Presbyterian Church of New York City, knowing of my
interest in hymnology, came to me and told me that he had
a very fine Netherlands melody associated with most militaristic
and unchristian words. He lamented the fact, and requested
me to write more suitable words, which could be used
for the Thanksgiving service at the Brick Church. The hymn
as you see it today, was the result.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">KREMSER</span> is named after Edward Kremser, 1838-1914, a
Viennese musician who arranged the tune from a Netherlands melody
dating to 1625. The composer is not known. It is a stirring piece of
music, simple in style, and easy to sing. It is equally impressive, whether
sung in measured, stately tones like a chorale, or in the gayer festive
mood in which young people like to sing. Children and young
people usually respond to this hymn with enthusiasm.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_16">16. Praise the Lord: ye heavens adore Him</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Foundling Hospital Collection</i></div>
<div class="author"><i>Stanza 3 by Edward Osler</i>, 1798-1863</div>
<p>A free rendering of some lines of Psalm 148 in which all the hosts of
heaven and earth join in a magnificent chorus of praise to God.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>The first two stanzas are anonymous. They were first published in
the <i>Foundling Hospital Collection</i>, a book of hymns and anthems compiled
by Thomas Coram, an English seaman, merchant captain and
philanthropist. In later life, Mr. Coram devoted his time and fortune to
the support of a children&rsquo;s hospital in which a chapel was also maintained
and the children trained in singing.</p>
<p>Edward Osler, author of the third stanza, was an English surgeon and
author of books on scientific as well as religious subjects. He was also
a distinguished hymnologist and wrote a number of versions of the
Psalms and hymns for use in the Church of England.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">FABEN</span> was composed by John Henry Wilcox, 1827-75,
Boston organist and expert in organ construction. The tune should not
be taken too fast; otherwise the short notes become choppy and the
effect is spoiled. Singers should avoid slurring the intervals of the
melody, especially the descending fourth at the end of the first, third
and seventh lines.</p>

at the beginning of the third score if the lines of all four stanzas had
been printed. Let the song leader remind them to look ahead for the
proper lines of each stanza before singing their solo part, and so avoid
some incongruities of thought!</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">CAMBRIDGE</span> is an effective tune but with most congregations
it needs some rehearsal before it is usable in a worship service.
The composer, John Randall, 1715-99, was an organist and Professor of
Music in Cambridge University. He was a friend of the poet Thomas
Gray.</p>

<div class="author"><i>Tate and Brady</i></div>
<p>A metrical version of Psalm 95, by Tate and Brady, two Irishmen
who collaborated in producing, in 1696, the <i>New Version</i> of the Psalms.
Their work partly supplanted the older version by Sternhold and Hopkins,
then in use.</p>
<p>Nahum Tate, 1652-1715, was the son of an Irish clergyman, and, like
Brady, received his education at Trinity College, Dublin. He was only
a second-rate poet but managed to receive appointment as Poet Laureate
of England in 1690.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Nicholas Brady, 1659-1726, was granted the honorary degree of Doctor
of Divinity from Dublin University for services rendered to the
Protestant cause. Among his many appointments were the chaplaincy to
the king of England and incumbency of Stratford-on-Avon. Tate and
Brady recast all of the Psalms into metrical verse in an attempt to improve
on the old version then in use in the churches. Their work was
done in a day when only the psalms were permitted to be sung in worship
services in England. The writing of hymns was still in the future.
Only a few of their renderings still find a place among our modern
English hymns. The <i>Hymnary</i> includes two besides this one, Nos. <a href="#hymn_583">583</a>
and <a href="#hymn_586">586</a>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> The tune was found in <i>St. Basil&rsquo;s Hymn Book</i> where it is
credited to Haydn, but we are not told which Haydn. No further information
concerning its origin has been traced. It is especially effective
when sung by a large congregation.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_19">19. When morning gilds the skies</h3>
<div class="author"><i>19th century</i></div>
<div class="author"><i>Tr. E. Caswall</i>, 1814-78</div>
<p>A radiant morning hymn of adoration. It comes from the German
song, &ldquo;Bei fr&uuml;hem Morgenlicht,&rdquo; of unknown authorship, which first appeared
in print in the <i>Katholisches Gesangbuch</i>, 1828, bearing the
title, &ldquo;A Christian Greeting.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Bei fr&uuml;hem Morgenlicht</p>
<p class="t0">Erwacht mein Herz und spricht.</p>
<p class="t">Gelobt sei Jesus Christus!</p>
<p class="t0">So sing ich fr&uuml;h and sp&auml;t,</p>
<p class="t0">Bei Arbeit und Gebet,</p>
<p class="t">Gelobt sei Jesus Christus!</p>
</div>
<p>The translator, Edward Caswall, was an English scholar and clergyman,
educated at Oxford. He left the Church of England to become a
Roman Catholic priest. Caswall did much for the sick poor and the
poor children in Birmingham, England, where he lived. He wrote excellent
original hymns and made many translations from German and
Latin sources. (See Nos. <a href="#hymn_88">88</a> and <a href="#hymn_155">155</a>.)</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">O SEIGNEUR</span> was composed or arranged by the Frenchman
L. Bourgeois, <i>c.</i> 1500- <i>c.</i> 1561, who was an adherent of Calvin and
followed him to Geneva in 1541. He was assigned by Calvin the task of
providing music for the metrical psalter, but his work was attended
with troubles and difficulties. Once he was thrown in prison for making
unauthorized alterations in certain well-known tunes. He tried
hard to introduce part-singing in a day when only unison singing was
permitted by Calvin. Not succeeding in this, he left Geneva and returned
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
to Paris, his birthplace. <span class="small">O SEIGNEUR</span> is a superb tune. It
gathers interest and force throughout its considerable length. The tune,
which also may be used as a choir anthem, should be sung in fairly lively
tempo to bring out its extraordinary power.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_20">20. Lord, in the morning</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Isaac Watts</i>, 1674-1748</div>
<p>Based on Psalm 5:3: &ldquo;My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O
Lord; in the morning will I direct my prayer to thee, and will look up.&rdquo;
Watts did not hesitate to change the wording of the Psalms, when necessary,
to &ldquo;Christianize&rdquo; them. In the preface to his book of <i>Psalms</i>, he
states his method and purpose in these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is necessary that I should inform my readers that they are
not to expect in this book an exact translation of the Psalms
of David. My design is to accommodate the Book of Psalms
to Christian Worship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For further comments on Watts see <a href="#hymn_11">Hymn 11</a>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">WARWICK</span>, a psalm-tune of somewhat ornamental style,
was composed by Samuel Stanley, 1767-1822, who for thirty-three years
was the leader of singing in Carr&rsquo;s Lane Meeting House, Birmingham,
England, where he made its music famous. He was a noted violincellist
and an authority on the music of Handel. His position in the church
was not then considered inconsistent with his being, for a time, keeper
of the town tavern.</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">LAUDES DOMINI</span> was composed by Joseph Barnby, 1838-96,
an English organist and one of the most prolific hymn-tune writers
of his time. He was conductor of the Royal Choral Society in London,
which presented many splendid performances of the great oratorios.
It is a reverent and vigorous tune, written especially for this hymn, and
makes a good processional.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_22">22. New every morning is the love</h3>
<div class="author"><i>John Keble</i>, 1792-1866</div>
<p>Taken from John Keble&rsquo;s <i>Christian Year</i>, a book of devotional poetry,
one of the great religious classics in the English language. The
original poem of sixteen stanzas is based on Lamentations 3:22b, 23a:
&ldquo;His compassions fail not. They are new every morning.&rdquo; The hymn
shows a deep appreciation of the beauties of the natural world, linking
them with the worship of God.</p>
<p>John Keble was educated at Oxford where he was an outstandingly
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
brilliant student. Later he taught at Oxford for nine years and then
spent thirteen years as curate in his father&rsquo;s church in Gloucestershire.
Following that he became vicar of Hursley where he rebuilt the parish
church with profits from his book, <i>The Christian Year</i>, which passed
through 90 editions during the author&rsquo;s lifetime. Keble was one of the
influential leaders in the so-called Oxford or Tractarian Movement in
England, an effort to emphasize worthier ideas of the church and a
greater dignity and beauty in worship.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">MELCOMBE</span>, a melody of fine balance and great dignity,
was composed by Samuel Webbe, 1740-1816, son of an English government
official in Minorca. He spent his early life as a cabinetmaker but
later turned to music, becoming a noted organist and composer of a
large quantity of secular and sacred music.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_23">23. Still, still with Thee</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Harriet Beecher Stowe</i>, 1811-96</div>
<p>Based on Psalm 139:18: &ldquo;When I awake I am still with Thee.&rdquo; It is
a beautiful, personal, morning hymn, expressing the soul&rsquo;s adoration
upon waking to find itself in the glad consciousness of the divine
presence.</p>
<p>Harriet Beecher Stowe belonged to a famous American family. Her
father, Lyman Beecher, and her brother, Henry Ward Beecher, were
eloquent and influential preachers in the Presbyterian and Congregational
churches, respectively. Harriet&rsquo;s girlhood was spent in Cincinnati,
Ohio, where her father was president of Lane Theological Seminary.
She married Calvin Ellis Stowe, of the Lane faculty. In 1852,
she published <i>Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin</i>, a story which became immensely
popular and made a notable contribution to the cause of freedom for
the slaves.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">CONSOLATION</span> is No. 9 of the 48 pieces, all of distinctive
lyric quality, composed by Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, and known as
<i>Songs without Words.</i> The tune appears here in slightly modified
form. It is well adapted for the hymn but suffers frequently from dragging.
It should be sung with a steady pace and clearly defined rhythm.</p>
<p>Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy was born in Hamburg, Germany, 1809,
the son of a Jewish banker. His father, Abraham Mendelssohn, wished
the children to be brought up as Protestant Christians and added the
name &ldquo;Bartholdy&rdquo; to distinguish them from the Jewish members of
the family. &ldquo;Bartholdy&rdquo; was the name of the proprietor of the garden
belonging to the family. Mendelssohn composed extensively for the
piano and wrote symphonies for the orchestra. Among his choral works
are the great oratorios, <i>Elijah</i> and <i>St. Paul</i>. A man of culture and
wealth, he travelled extensively and was popular wherever he went,
especially in England. He died in Leipzig in 1847.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_24">24. Father, we praise Thee</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Gregory the Great</i>, 540-604</div>
<div class="author"><i>Tr. Percy Dearmer</i>, 1867-1936</div>
<p>The original of this morning hymn is attributed to Gregory the
Great, Pope Gregory I, a sincere man, devoted to missions and reforms
within the church, and one of the greatest of the line of Popes.
The date of his election to the papacy, <span class="small">A.D.</span> 590, is usually given by
church historians as the end of the period of the Ancient Church and
the beginning of the period of the Middle Ages&mdash;a witness to the importance
of Gregory. A man of unblemished character and statesmanlike
wisdom, he had a noble vision and ambition for Christianity and
took a keen interest in the ritual and music of the church. Though
not original or scholarly, he was a voluminous writer and had much
influence in his time. He sent out missionaries, such as Augustine to
England, and labored incessantly to purify and strengthen the church,
care for its poor, and bring Christianity to the heathen. Gregory was
particularly interested in the music of the church; and the &ldquo;Gregorian
Chants,&rdquo; many of them composed by him, became the basis of cathedral
music for a thousand years. He did away with certain embellishments
which had crept in through the influence of Ambrose, and inaugurated
the use of the solemn, stately chants which bear his name.</p>
<p>The translation of this hymn is by Percy Dearmer, an English hymnologist
and clergyman who became Canon of Westminster, London,
in 1931. He edited <i>Songs of Praise</i>, adopted widely in England for use
in churches and public schools.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">CHRISTI SANCTORUM</span> is a tune of uncertain origin taken
from a book by Francois de la Feill&eacute;e, entitled <i>Methode du Plain Chant</i>,
published in 1782. The melody, easily within range of all voices, is
well adapted for unison singing. It is most effective when sung somewhat
slowly. Though the tune appears in a book of plainsong, the
melody has rhythm and is measured, and has none of the characteristics
of a plainsong.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_25">25. Awake, my soul, and with the sun</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Thomas Ken</i>, 1637-1711</div>
<p>Taken from a <i>Manual of Prayers</i>, which Bishop Ken wrote for Winchester
College students in 1674. It appeared as the &ldquo;Morning Hymn.&rdquo;
The preface of the book admonished the boys &ldquo;to be sure to sing the
Morning and Evening Hymn in your chamber devoutly.&rdquo; Both the
Morning and Evening Hymn (<a href="#hymn_33">33</a>) had for the closing stanza the famous
doxology, &ldquo;Praise God from whom all blessings flow,&rdquo; now sung by the
whole Christian church. The original poem had fourteen stanzas. According
to Julian, this hymn is one of four at the head of all hymns in
the English language.</p>
<p>Thomas Ken was an English poet and clergyman and had considerable
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
musical talent. He was a man unafraid to declare his convictions.
He once refused to read, at the king&rsquo;s command, a certain document to
his parishioners, and was imprisoned for his defiance. He finally lost
his bishopric because he refused to swear allegiance to Mary and William
of Orange when they became rulers of England. Ken was known
for his saintly character, his great ability and eloquence as a preacher,
and his pioneering in the art of hymn writing.</p>
<p>That all hymns must be written in the third person, as is sometimes
asserted, is disproved by this great hymn in its use of &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;my.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="author"><i>Charles Wesley</i>, 1707-88</div>
<p>One of the greatest morning hymns in the English language, based
on Mal. 4:2: &ldquo;But unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousness
arise with healing in his wings.&rdquo; James Montgomery called
it &ldquo;one of Charles Wesley&rsquo;s loveliest progeny.&rdquo; It pictures Christ as the
true Light and the Sun of Righteousness triumphing over the darkness
of sin and grief.</p>
<p>Charles Wesley was the second youngest in a family of nineteen children
and became the &ldquo;sweet singer of Methodism.&rdquo; He and Isaac Watts
were the most important hymnists of the 18th century in England.</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">LUX PRIMA</span> is by the French composer, Charles F. Gounod,
1818-93, a musician of a deeply religious nature. Gounod had taken
two years of theology with the expectation of becoming ordained,
but later decided that his greatest contribution to religion would be
through music. His outstanding religious work is the oratorio, <i>The
Redemption</i>. While composing it, he used to spend hours in Notre
Dame Cathedral in prayer and meditation. <span class="small">LUX PRIMA</span> is a stirring tune,
building up to a climax at &ldquo;Day-star,&rdquo; and is widely used as a processional.</p>

original poem of 13 stanzas begins with the words, &ldquo;<i>Seele, du muszt
munter werden</i>.&rdquo; The hymn, expressing the glories of a new day, is
especially suitable for use in schools and colleges. It is a translation of

<p>Friedrich Rudolph Ludwig, Freiherr von Canitz, was born in Berlin
in 1654. He was a distinguished diplomat, a philanthropist, and a
devout Christian. In the early morning of his last day on earth, August
11, 1699, ill with dropsy, he gazed at the rising sun and exclaimed,
&ldquo;Oh, if the sight of this created sun is so charming and beautiful, what
will be the sight of the unspeakable glory of the Creator himself!&rdquo;
He was <i>Staatrath</i> (State Counsellor) at the time of his death.</p>
<p>The translator, Rev. Henry J. Buckoll, was educated at Oxford and
spent most of his life teaching. He edited several collections of songs
for schools and in 1842 published <i>Hymns Translated from the German</i>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">HAYDN</span> comes from a tune in one of the movements of
a string quartet by Franz Joseph Haydn, 1732-1809, the great Austrian
composer, and important figure in the history of music. He was affectionately
named &ldquo;Papa Haydn&rdquo; by Mozart. He wrote church music,
song, opera, and oratorio, over 100 symphonies and 83 string quartets.
His <i>Creation</i>, a sacred oratorio, is widely known. He was devoutly religious
and did not hesitate to ascribe his musical scores to God&rsquo;s
glory. He gave as one of his reasons for writing music: &ldquo;that the weary
and worn or the man burdened with affairs might enjoy something of
solace and refreshment.&rdquo; There is a cheerfulness and optimism about
his music which appeals to amateur and professional alike. Haydn was
a teacher as well as composer and numbered among his pupils Mozart
and Beethoven.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_28">28. Now on land and sea descending</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Samuel Longfellow</i>, 1819-92</div>
<p>Written for use in a series of vesper services the author was conducting
in his church. It was published, with other hymns, in a small book
called <i>Vespers</i>. This hymn and &ldquo;Again as evening&rsquo;s shadow falls&rdquo;
(<a href="#hymn_280">No. 280</a>), also by Longfellow, have become two of the most-loved evening
hymns in the English language.</p>
<p>Samuel Longfellow, younger brother of the poet, Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow, was born and died in Portland, Maine. He was educated
at Harvard for the ministry and served congregations in Fall River,
Mass.; Brooklyn; and Germantown, Pa., resigning the last charge to
write his brother&rsquo;s <i>Life</i>, 1886. Though a Unitarian, he speaks of Christ
as Lord and Saviour and accepted the miracles of the New Testament.
He edited several important hymn books and wrote a number of hymns
of excellent quality. Thirteen of his compositions are included in the
<i>Hymnary</i>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">VESPERS</span> is by the Russian composer Dimitri Stephanovitch
Bortniansky who was born at Gloukoff, in the Ukraine, 1752, and
died at St. Petersburg, 1825. He studied music at Moscow, St. Petersburg,
and Venice, Italy, the Empress Catherine of Russia supplying the
necessary funds. (It was this Empress Catherine who extended an invitation
in 1786 to Prussian Mennonites to settle in South Russia,
promising religious toleration, military exemption, and other special
privileges.) Bortniansky became Director of the Imperial Kapelle, the
Empress&rsquo; Church Choir. He was a distinguished composer of sacred
music and has had a great and lasting influence on Russian church
music. From his pen came the well-known chorale tune, &ldquo;<i>Ich bete an
die Macht der Liebe</i>&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_517">No. 517</a>).</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;Jubilate&rdquo; means &ldquo;to shout for joy.&rdquo; It comes from the
same Latin root as &ldquo;jubilee&rdquo; and &ldquo;jubilant.&rdquo; Its English pronunciation
in singing is Jo&#772;o-b&#301;-l&auml;-t&#301;. If you prefer the Latin, sing it Yo&#772;o-b&#257;-l&auml;-t&#301;.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_29">29. Now the day is over</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Sabine Baring-Gould</i>, 1834-1924</div>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid;</p>
<p class="t0">Yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The hymn was written for children, but is suitable for worshippers
of all ages.</p>
<p>Sabine Baring-Gould was educated at Cambridge and became a clergyman
of the Church of England. He was a man of great industry and
versatility, and possessed a wide range of interests. He wrote books on
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
travel, biography, history, and is the author of several novels. He also
edited several collections of folk songs. Baring-Gould is the author of
&ldquo;Onward Christian soldiers,&rdquo; another hymn written for children, which
has received a much wider use than originally intended.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">MERRIAL</span> is a favorite tune for choir use in evening
services. The average congregation can learn to sing it without difficulty,
and when sung slowly and thoughtfully, it constitutes a deeply
moving evening prayer.</p>
<p>For comments on the composer, Joseph Barnby, see <a href="#hymn_21">Hymn 21</a>.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_30">30. Sun of my soul, Thou Savior dear</h3>
<div class="author"><i>John Keble</i>, 1792-1866</div>
<p>Another evening hymn, widely used, and destined to live as long
as English hymns are sung. It is taken from the author&rsquo;s <i>Christian Year</i>,
a book of devotional poetry which sold 305,500 copies in forty-six years.
The original poem of fourteen stanzas, composed November 25, 1820,
appeared with the title, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis Gone, that Bright and Orb&egrave;d Blaze,&rdquo;
and was headed with the text, &ldquo;Abide with us&rdquo; (Luke 24:29). The hymn
represents a lone traveller pressing on his way after the sun has set, but
trusting in Christ, the &ldquo;Sun of the soul,&rdquo; for guidance and protection,
and lifting a prayer for the sick and poor and the helpless. Tennyson,
too, likened Christ to the sun. Asked what Christ meant to him he
paused beside a flower in the garden and answered: &ldquo;What the sun is
to that flower, Jesus Christ is to my soul. He is the Sun of my soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For further comments on John Keble see <a href="#hymn_22">Hymn 22</a>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">HURSLEY</span> is a good tune but not as good as the original,
&ldquo;<i>Grosser Gott, wir loben Dich</i>&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_519">No. 519</a>), from which some unknown
person adapted it. The melody and harmonization have been changed,
not for the better, to suit the English words. &ldquo;Hursley&rdquo; was the name
of the parish of which Keble was vicar, and the tune was doubtless
given this name when it came to be associated with Keble&rsquo;s hymn.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_31">31. Day is dying in the west</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Mary Lathbury</i>, 1841-1913</div>
<p>An evening hymn of high rank which has been used widely in American
churches during the past half century.</p>
<p>Mary A. Lathbury, daughter of a Methodist minister, was a successful
art teacher but is remembered chiefly for her work with the Methodist
Sunday School Union and her literary contributions to periodicals for
young people. The &ldquo;Look Up&rdquo; Legion which she founded had for its
motto, Edward Everett Hale&rsquo;s four rules of good conduct:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Look up, not down;</p>
<p class="t0">Look forward, not back;</p>
<p class="t0">Look out, not in,</p>
<p class="t0">And lend a hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Miss Lathbury wrote this hymn for use at the vesper services at Lake
Chautauqua, in western New York, where hundreds of young people,
eager to deepen their spiritual life, have met every year since 1873 for
Bible study and prayer. This hymn and &ldquo;Break Thou the Bread of
Life&rdquo; give the author a permanent place in American hymnody.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">CHAUTAUQUA</span> was written especially for Miss Lathbury&rsquo;s
hymn. William F. Sherwin, 1826-88, studied music under Lowell
Mason and later became a teacher of vocal music. He was unusually
successful in leading choral groups and was appointed music director
at Lake Chautauqua. The tune is dignified and stately, yet simple. The
refrain should be sung softly at the beginning and rise gradually to a
climax.</p>

<p>From an anonymous 8th-century or earlier Greek hymn. Some authorities
believe it to be an expansion of the Greek candle lighting hymn
(<a href="#hymn_34">No. 34</a>), also translated by Robert Bridges. The editors of the <i>Hymnary</i>,
in search of a poem to fit the well-known <span class="small">UNTER LILIEN JENER
FREUDEN</span> tune in the <i>Gesangbuch mit Noten</i>, found for it this beautiful
evening hymn published in the <i>American Oxford Hymnal</i>.</p>
<p>The translator, Robert Bridges, was one of England&rsquo;s great literary
scholars who gave serious attention to hymnology. After graduating
from Eton and Oxford, he turned his attention to medicine and became
a distinguished surgeon. At the early age of 38, however, he retired
from medicine to give himself to literature and music. In 1913, he was
made Poet Laureate of England. His most significant work in hymnology
was the famous <i>Yattendon Hymnal</i>, which he published in 1899
while living in the village of Yattendon. It consisted of 100 hymns, 44
of which were from his own pen, either as author or translator. The
hymns were set to music derived largely from the <i>Genevan Psalter</i>. The
hymnal represented an extraordinarily high standard, both as to words
and music, but it never became popular, and copies of it are nearly
impossible to find.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> The tune, <span class="small">UNTER LILIEN JENER FREUDEN</span>, is found at No.
546 of the <i>Gesangbuch mit Noten</i> where it is set to a poem by
J. Allendorf. No information has been traced concerning the composer,
J. Voigtl&auml;nder.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_33">33. All praise to Thee, my God this night</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Thomas Ken</i>, 1637-1711</div>
<p>Based on Psalm 91:4: &ldquo;He shall cover thee with his feathers; and
under his wings shalt thou trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the &ldquo;Evening Hymn,&rdquo; whereas <a href="#hymn_25">No. 25</a> is the &ldquo;Morning
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
Hymn&rdquo; which Bishop Ken wrote for the devotional use of students at
Winchester College. His endeavor was to express in simple, fitting
words the thoughts that ought to be in the minds of the boys of the
school &ldquo;and all other devout Christians&rdquo; in the evening. The two
hymns were published in 1695 and have been growing in fame and
power these two and one-half centuries. Both concluded with the doxology,
&ldquo;Praise God from whom all blessings flow,&rdquo; now known and
sung throughout Christendom.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> The tune, <span class="small">EVENING HYMN</span>, was originally in canon form,
i.e., a form in which one voice begins the melody which is then imitated
note for note by some other voice, as in a &ldquo;round.&rdquo; Tallis, as was
customary at the time, started the melody in the tenor, imitated by the
soprano. The tune used here is a later and altered form which, in the
judgment of this writer, is less interesting than the canonic form used
in many hymnbooks. Its choice was an editorial inadvertence.</p>
<p>Thomas Tallis, composer of the tune, died in 1585. The exact date
of his birth, probably before 1520, remains uncertain. Styled the &ldquo;Father
of English Cathedral Music,&rdquo; he was chorister at St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral,
London, and later held important posts as organist. He was indisputably
the greatest English musician of his age, and <span class="small">EVENING HYMN</span> is his
most famous tune.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_34">34. O Gladsome Light, O Grace</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Greek 1st or 2d Century</i></div>
<div class="author"><i>Tr. Robert Bridges,</i> 1844-1930</div>
<p>This is the oldest Christian hymn in common use, belonging to the
first or second century. It was sung by the early Christians as a hymn
of thanksgiving at the lighting of the candles at the vesper services in
the church and probably also in the home. It is still so used in the
Eastern churches. St. Basil wrote c. 370 regarding this hymn: &ldquo;We
cannot say who is the father of this expression at the Thanksgiving of
the Lighting of the Lamps; but it is an <i>ancient</i> formula which the
people repeat.&rdquo; So in <span class="small">A.D.</span> 370 the hymn was already ancient!</p>
<p>For comments on the translator, Robert Bridges, see <a href="#hymn_32">Hymn 32</a>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> The tune <span class="small">NUNC DIMITTIS</span> is by the French musician, Louis
Bourgeois, c. 1510-61, the best melodist of his day, and composer
of most of the music for the <i>Genevan Psalter</i>, a French metrical version
of the Psalms published in 1549. Many of his melodies have been
altered, as for example, &ldquo;Old Hundredth,&rdquo; but this one has come to
us unchanged. It is a glorious melody which needs to be listened to
repeatedly to be appreciated. The harmonization is by Claude Goudimel,
c. 1505/10-72, another eminent Protestant musician, who provided
harmonies for many of the Genevan psalm tunes. Goudimel&rsquo;s life came
to an end in the massacre of St. Bartholomew in 1572, one of those
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
tragedies during the counter-reformation in which the Protestants suffered
at the hands of the Jesuits.</p>

<div class="author"><i>Stanza 3, Richard Whateley</i>, 1787-1863</div>
<p>The original hymn consisted of the first stanza only which was written
by Reginald Heber after hearing the tune used here played by a
Welch harpist in a home where Heber was visiting. Retiring to a quiet
place, he promptly wrote the stanza to suit the melody.</p>
<p>For comments on Reginald Heber see <a href="#hymn_1">Hymn 1</a>.</p>
<p>William Mercer, author of the second stanza, was a clergyman in the
Church of England in Sheffield. In 1857, he issued <i>The Church Psalter
and Hymn Book</i>, the most important Church of England book of its
time. His aim was to promote greater participation by the congregation
in the hymn singing.</p>
<p>Richard Whately was archbishop of Dublin. He was a man of great
brilliance of mind, though, it is said, he had no ear for music and no
eye for natural beauty.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> The tune <span class="small">AR HYD Y NOS</span> is a Welsh traditional melody commonly
associated with the words &ldquo;All through the night.&rdquo; It appears in
many modern hymnals. A growing number of folk tunes are being used
for hymn tunes.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_36">36. Softly now the light of day</h3>
<div class="author"><i>George Washington Doane</i>, 1799-1859</div>
<p>An American hymn characterized by simplicity and grace, and sung
the world over wherever the English language is spoken. It appeared
in 1824 in a collection of poems, <i>Songs by the Way</i>, with the heading
&ldquo;Evening.&rdquo; It is based on Psalm 141:2, &ldquo;Let my prayer be set
forth before Thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the
evening sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Washington Doane was born in Trenton, New Jersey, in
1799, the year that the &ldquo;Father of our Country&rdquo; died; hence his name.
He was educated at Union College, Schenectady, New York, and ordained,
at the age of 22, in the Episcopal Church. At the early age of
33 he was made bishop of New Jersey. A pioneer in education, and
ahead of his time in many things, his life was full of trials. But his
exceptional talents, learning and force of character made him one of
the great church leaders of his time.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">SEYMOUR</span> is by the eminent German composer of opera,
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
Carl M. von Weber, 1786-1826. This tune, a great favorite, is from
the opening chorus of his opera, <i>Oberon</i>, which is sung while fairies
&ldquo;trip it lightly&rdquo; on the stage. When contributions towards the musical
edition of the famous English book, <i>Hymns Ancient and Modern</i>,
London, 1861, were invited by advertisement, the editor, W. H. Monk,
received more requests for the insertion of this tune than any other,
despite its secular origin.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_37">37. At even, when the sun was set</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Henry Twells</i>, 1823-1900</div>
<p>This evening hymn, a prayer for the healing of our bodily as well
as spiritual ills, has been translated into many foreign tongues, and is
found in nearly all standard hymn books both in America and abroad.
The original has eight stanzas. It is based on the touching evening
scene described in Mark 1:32, &ldquo;At even, when the sun was set, they
brought unto him all that were sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Twells was ordained in 1849 in the Church of England.
Among the parishes he served was Stratford-on-Avon, the birthplace of
Shakespeare. At the time he wrote this hymn, he was headmaster of a
large grammar school and penned the verses one afternoon while the
boys were writing an examination.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> The tune, <span class="small">ANGELUS</span>, appeared in somewhat different form
in <i>Heilige Seelenlust</i>, one of a series of Catholic collections of hymns
in Germany, written in the vernacular, and edited by Johann Scheffler.
The tune is credited to Georg Josephi, a German musician of whom
little is known except that he was the musical editor of <i>Heilige Seelenlust</i>.
It is a tune of rare beauty though its modulations into several
different keys makes it more difficult to sing than some and gives it a
sense of restlessness not found in other popular tunes.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_38">38. Savior, breathe an evening blessing</h3>
<div class="author"><i>James Edmeston</i>, 1791-1867</div>
<p>This hymn ranks with the best of the evening hymns of the English
language though it is practically all that survives of the more than
two thousand hymns that came from the too prolific pen of the author.</p>
<p>James Edmeston, a member of the Church of England, was an eminent
London architect and surveyor who had a great love for and interest
in children and possessed a gift for writing sacred poetry. He had
the habit of writing a hymn every Sunday and reading it at family
worship.</p>
<p>During the Boxer uprising in China in 1900, in which many Americans
lost their lives, a group of missionaries, beleaguered outside of
Shanghai, found in this hymn the expression of their feelings, as well
as a great source of comfort. One of them wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Separated from home and friends, facing death in a far-off
land, and full of tenderest feelings, we lifted our hearts in
song:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Though destruction walk around us,</p>
<p class="t">Though the arrows past us fly:</p>
<p class="t0">Angel guards from Thee surround us;</p>
<p class="t">We are safe if Thou art nigh.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Out of the storm each soul, renewing its strength, mounted
up with wings as eagles and found peace in the secret of His
presence. Our Saviour breathed, in very deed, &ldquo;an evening
blessing,&rdquo; the fragrance of which remains even unto this day.
The last verse of the hymn, &ldquo;Should swift death this night
o&rsquo;ertake us,&rdquo; was omitted. It seemed too probable that it
might. We wanted only to think of the safe-keeping, and such,
thank God, it proved to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> The tune <span class="small">EVENING PRAYER</span> was written by Stebbins while
music director at Tremont Temple, Boston, as a response to be
sung after the morning prayer. Two years later it was set to this evening
hymn by the composer himself, for use in an evangelistic campaign
in Providence, R. I. Stebbins writes, &ldquo;I arranged to have a male
choir of 20 voices sing the music as set to the beautiful hymn, and to
my gratification found they were admirably suited to each other. Since
then the hymn has been used in many gospel hymn books and church
hymnals, both here and abroad. It has been used also in St. Paul&rsquo;s
Cathedral, in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George C. Stebbins, 1846-1945, was born and reared on a farm in
New York. He became interested in music through the country singing
school. After serving as music director at the First Baptist Church,
Chicago, and Tremont Temple, Boston, he became associated with D.
L. Moody and helped organize choruses for many of Moody&rsquo;s evangelistic
campaigns both here and abroad. He was co-editor with Ira
Sankey and James McGranahan of various editions of <i>Gospel Hymns</i>
and was himself one of the best composers of gospel hymn tunes. He
lived to be nearly 100 years old.</p>
<p>The hymn is also set to the tune &ldquo;Ringe Recht&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_147">147</a>) in some hymnals.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_39">39. Unheard the dews around me fall</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Anonymous</i></div>
<p>This hymn, emphasizing the silences of God as manifested in the
world without and within, is of anonymous authorship. It is found in
<i>Hymns of the Spirit</i> but most of the other modern hymnals have
overlooked it.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">WINDSOR</span> is an English tune of unknown origin. It was
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
set to Psalm 116 in a book of Psalm tunes by M. William Damon, published
in 1591. It is one of a number of tunes written in the minor
mode which appear in the <i>Hymnary</i>. Note that the &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; closes
with the chord in F major, in keeping with the general practice of following
a minor tune with an &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; in which the last chord is in the
major mode.</p>
<p>In <i>Songs of Praise</i>, London, 1931, this tune is set to the hymn
&ldquo;Jesus, the very thought of Thee&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_155">155</a>).</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_40">40. Abide with me; fast falls the eventide</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Henry F. Lyte,</i> 1793-1847</div>
<p>One of the great consolation songs of Christianity. It is really not an
evening hymn, but for a person in his last illness, when the thought
of passing through the gateway of death, and the glory of the great beyond
are the soul&rsquo;s vital concern. It has long been sung at evening
services because, presumably, the end of the natural day suggests the
evening of life, and the mood of the tune is so well suited to the pensive
quietness of the close of day.</p>
<p>Henry F. Lyte, a Scotsman, was a young clergyman in the Church of
England when he wrote this hymn. There is a popular tradition
that he wrote it near the end of his life when ill health compelled
him to resign his parish and after he held his last communion
on September 4, 1847. But James Moffatt, the distinguished historian
and translator of the Bible, gives a different account of its origin. He
says the hymn was inspired during the fatal illness of an intimate
friend of the author, Rev. William A. Le Hunte. Dr. Lyte was constantly
at the side of his dying friend who, in his closing hours, repeatedly
said these words, &ldquo;Abide with me,&rdquo; which moved Dr. Lyte to
write the hymn. Twenty-seven years later, 1847, when he felt his own
end approaching, he recalled the hymn.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">EVENTIDE</span> is Monk&rsquo;s best known tune. In a letter to J.
C. Hadden, Mrs. Monk wrote: &ldquo;This tune was written at a time of
great sorrow&mdash;when together we watched, as we did daily, the glories
of the setting sun. As the golden rays faded, he took up some paper
and pencilled that tune which has gone over all the world.&rdquo; The composition
is said to have been completed in ten minutes. It was the last
hymn sung by the Canadian nurse Edith Cavell before she suffered
martyrdom in Belgium, October 12, 1915.</p>
<p>Wm. H. Monk, 1823-89, English organist and composer, devoted his
life to the service of church music. For forty years he held the post of
organist at King&rsquo;s College, London, and St. Matthias, Stoke Newington,
devoting himself to the advancement of good congregational singing.
&ldquo;He taught many to praise God who had never praised Him before; he
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
taught others to praise Him more worthily than hitherto.&rdquo; He was the
music editor of the famous <i>Hymns Ancient and Modern</i>, published in
England, 1861.</p>
<h4 class="b">CLOSE OF WORSHIP</h4>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_41">41. Blest be the tie that binds</h3>
<div class="author"><i>John Fawcett</i>, 1740-1817</div>
<p>This hymn is often sung at the close of church meetings. Sometimes
the custom of the people joining hands while singing is observed.</p>
<p>John Fawcett, an English Baptist minister, was serving a small country
church in Yorkshire when he received and accepted a call to a large
city church in London, which paid a salary more suited to the needs
of his big family. His farewell sermon had been preached, six or seven
wagons stood loaded with his furniture and books, and all was ready for
his departure. But when the members of his humble flock turned out
to bid farewell, many of them in tears, and imploring him to stay, it
was more than he or Mrs. Fawcett could stand. He ordered the wagons
unloaded and the furniture put back in its place, and sent a message to
the London church that he was not coming. Afterwards he wrote this
hymn which was to become one of the most famous in the English
language.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">DENNIS</span> is simple and easy of performance, yet pleasing
and effective. The tune was composed by Hans Georg N&auml;geli, 1768-1836,
a Swiss, who was born near Zurich where he spent most of his
life as music publisher, composer, and teacher. He was a prominent
figure in public school music and was greatly interested in church music.</p>
<p>Lowell Mason found this melody in manuscript form and arranged it
for use as a church tune.</p>
<p>For comments on Lowell Mason see <a href="#hymn_12">Hymn 12</a>. The tune &ldquo;Boylston&rdquo;
(<a href="#hymn_214">214</a>) is also used with this hymn.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_42">42. The Lord be with us as we bend</h3>
<div class="author"><i>John Ellerton</i>, 1826-93</div>
<p>The hymn is particularly appropriate for the close of an evening
service.</p>
<p>John Ellerton was a minister of the Church of England, a teacher,
author, and one of England&rsquo;s most distinguished hymnists. He assisted
in editing the famous <i>Hymns Ancient and Modern</i>, London, 1861.
He was early surrounded with religious influences and had a happy
childhood life. Of his parents he wrote, &ldquo;I used to feel how happy
my father and mother were, even more than how good they were.&rdquo;
He composed about fifty hymns and made about ten translations,
a large proportion of which have found their way into church
hymnals. He refused to take out a copyright for any of his hymns,
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
saying that &ldquo;if any are counted worthy to contribute to Christ&rsquo;s praise
in the congregation, one ought to feel very thankful and humble.&rdquo;
His hymns, of which there are eight in the <i>Hymnary</i>, are elevated
in tone and devotional spirit.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">BEATITUDO</span> was written for the Revised Edition of <i>Hymns
Ancient and Modern</i>, 1875, and was set to the words, &ldquo;How bright

<div class="author"><i>John Ellerton</i>, 1826-93</div>
<p>This, the most popular of Ellerton&rsquo;s hymns, was originally written
in 1866 for a choir festival. It was revised and condensed to these four
verses, rich in poetic beauty and spiritual power, to take a high place
among our evening hymns. The first stanza may be used with good
effect as a choral benediction. The last stanza was sung at Ellerton&rsquo;s
funeral on June 20, 1893.</p>

<p>Edward John Hopkins, 1818-1901, was a distinguished English church
musician who served as organist in several important London churches,
including Westminster Abbey. He was a prolific composer of church
music of fine quality&mdash;services, hymn-tunes, anthems, organ pieces&mdash;and
enjoyed a great reputation as editor of hymn books.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_44">44. O Savior, bless us ere we go</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Frederick W. Faber</i>, 1814-63</div>
<p>A hymn for the close of evening worship.</p>
<p>Frederick W. Faber was educated at Oxford and became a minister
in the Church of England. He began his parish work at Elton where
he became a forceful preacher and was known for his fine Christian
character and lovely spirit. Church attendance increased, the parish
grew, and the people who had been known for their intemperance and
immorality were now reputed for their thrift and good behavior.</p>
<p>Under the influence of John Henry Newman, Faber changed his
views and joined the Roman Catholic Church. After a trip to Rome, he
lived at Birmingham where he formed, with eight others, a community
called &ldquo;Brothers of the Will of God.&rdquo; Later he moved to London where
he continued his service in the Catholic Church until his death at the
age of forty-nine. He wrote many theological and devotional books but
is best known for his hymns of which he wrote 150, among which are
such favorites as &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a wideness in God&rsquo;s mercy&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_58">58</a>) and &ldquo;Faith
of our fathers&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_154">154</a>). His hymns are numbered among the treasures
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
of English hymnody. They are devotional in spirit and with slight alterations
appropriate for use in all Christian churches.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">SURREY</span> is a beautiful tune which became immediately popular
and has remained so, especially in England. The composer,
Henry Carey, 1692-1743, was a teacher in boarding schools and private
families in England. He composed a large number of secular songs
and was only incidentally a writer of church music.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_46">46. Mighty God, while angels bless Thee</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Robert Robinson</i>, 1735-90</div>
<p>The author of this hymn had a unique career. Robert Robinson,
born in Norfolk, England, of lowly parentage, was left fatherless at
eight to be the sole support of his widowed mother. At fourteen he
was apprenticed to a barber in London who frequently reprimanded
him for giving too much time to the reading of books and too little to
business. At seventeen he heard the great evangelist Whitefield preach
a sermon on Matthew 3:7 and decided to dedicate his life to God. His
complete conversion he dates a few years later, 1755. He began preaching
under the Methodists but soon developed independent views and
in 1759 he received adult baptism and united with the Baptists. Shortly
afterwards he became the pastor of a small Baptist church in the university
town of Cambridge. He was a gifted scholar, and though he
had little formal education, he held the respect of Cambridge students,
notwithstanding the taunts of university professors. Serving a small
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
and poor congregation and being without finances to support his large
family, he helped himself by engaging in farming and carrying on
business as a coal and corn merchant while preaching twice a Sunday
and holding evangelistic meetings during the week. In this he succeeded
in a very remarkable measure, aided by the fact that he knew
the soil and the tillers of the soil and was gifted with the sense of
humor and a Spurgeon-like wit. Besides this hymn, he also wrote
the well-known hymn, &ldquo;Come, Thou fount of every blessing&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_189">189</a>).</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">CRUCIFER</span>, originally known as &ldquo;Bethany,&rdquo; was composed
by Henry Smart for &ldquo;Jesus, I my cross have taken.&rdquo; The composer
favored unison singing of this melody, at moderate tempo. Most
congregations will find the pitch range in the melody too wide for
best results in unison singing.</p>
<p>Henry Smart, 1813-1879, turned from the legal profession to devote
his life to music. Though largely self-taught, he became one of England&rsquo;s
distinguished organists and builder of organs. He suffered from
poor eyesight and the last fourteen years of his life he was totally
blind, but he kept on playing and composing for he had a very retentive
memory and possessed a rare skill in extempore playing. Smart
was a strong advocate of congregational singing, but favored the unison
singing of melodies, and had a decided prejudice against what he considered
unduly fast congregational singing.</p>

to leave its exact origin in doubt. It found its way into English hymnals
soon after it was published in <i>Vollst&auml;ndige Sammlung der gew&ouml;hnlichen
Melodien zum Mainzer Gesangbuche</i>, by X. L. Hartig, in 1833.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_48">48. This is my Father&rsquo;s world</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Maltbie D. Babcock</i>, 1858-1901</div>
<p>The original has sixteen stanzas, each beginning with the words
&ldquo;This is my Father&rsquo;s world,&rdquo; a good slogan to begin and end the day.
It appeared in the author&rsquo;s <i>Thoughts for Every Day Living</i>, a book
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
of religious verse. The hymn expresses a confident attitude toward life
and a buoyant faith in God.</p>
<p>Maltbie D. Babcock, prominent Presbyterian minister, was born in
Syracuse, New York, graduated from Syracuse University and Auburn
Seminary and then began his first pastorate at the First Presbyterian
Church, Lockport, N. Y. His second pastorate was at Brown Memorial
Church, Baltimore, where he was popular with the students at Johns
Hopkins University. He then received a call to the Brick Church, New
York City, where he became the successor of Henry van Dyke. In his
student days he was known as a fine student, a great athlete, a good
musician, and a friend to all. He loved young people and during his
ministry they turned to him for counsel.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> The tune <span class="small">TERRA BEATA</span> is simple, light in movement, and
easy to sing. It was composed by Franklin Sheppard, 1852-1930, a
Philadelphia business man, Presbyterian layman, and friend of Dr.
Babcock. Sheppard was also an accomplished musician. He modestly
attributed the tune to an old English folk melody, but it is known now
that he himself was the composer. He named the tune &ldquo;Terra Beata,&rdquo;
happy or blessed earth.</p>
<p>The arrangement in the <i>Hymnary</i>, known as &ldquo;Terra Patris,&rdquo; is by
Edward Shippen Barnes, a contemporary American organist and composer.
His harmonization is a little more difficult to sing but also more
interesting than the original by Sheppard.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_49">49. Let the whole creation cry</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Stopford A. Brooke</i>, 1832-1916</div>
<p>The hymn is an imitation of Psalm 148. It is a universal call to
praise rather than an expression of praise, hence it is addressed not
to God but to his creation everywhere, as a call to worship God. The
hymn is characterized by literary grace, simplicity, and tenderness, and
is included in many modern hymnals.</p>
<p>Stopford A. Brooke, born in Ireland, was educated at Dublin, then
became a clergyman in the Anglican Church. For a time he was one of
the most popular preachers in London. In 1880, being restive under the
doctrinal standards of the church, he severed his relation with the Anglicans
and continued a ministry of preaching and lecturing and writing
as an independent, not associated with any denomination. His <i>Life
and Letters of F. W. Robertson</i> ranks among the classic biographies.
In 1881, he compiled <i>Christian Hymns</i> for use in his own congregation,
in which this hymn is found, the original having ten stanzas.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ROLAND</span> is an easy, flowing tune which congregations love to
sing after learning it well. It is suitable for use as a processional. The
composer, Caleb Simmer, born 1856, was an American musician. His
sacred pieces include anthems, quartets, cantatas, and organ music.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_50">50. The spacious firmament on high</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Joseph Addison</i>, 1672-1719</div>
<p>This hymn was praised by Lord Selbourne as &ldquo;a very perfect and
finished composition, taking rank among the best hymns of the English
language.&rdquo; The author, Joseph Addison, was an eminent Englishman
of letters. Dr. Samuel Johnson said of him, &ldquo;Whoever wishes to attain
an English style, familiar, but not coarse, elegant but not ostentatious,
must give his days and nights to the volumes of Addison.&rdquo; In 1712,
Addison wrote a series of essays in the <i>Spectator</i>, concluding each essay
with a hymn. In the issue of August 23, this hymn, a free rendering
of Psalm 19, formed the conclusion to an essay on &ldquo;The Proper
Means of Strengthening and Confirming Faith in the Mind of Man.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">CREATION</span> is an adaptation of a part of the magnificent
chorus (No. 14) in Haydn&rsquo;s oratorio, <i>The Creation</i>. For comments on
Haydn, see Hymn <a href="#hymn_27">No. 27</a>.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_51">51. For the beauty of the earth</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Folliott S. Pierpoint</i>, 1835-1917</div>
<p>This delightful hymn of thanksgiving was originally written for the
communion service to bring the note of joy into the solemn sacrament,
making it truly an &ldquo;eucharist.&rdquo; It is now used frequently at Thanksgiving
and children&rsquo;s services. It names many causes for praise and
thanksgiving, from the &ldquo;beauty of the earth&rdquo; to the &ldquo;church that lifteth
holy hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The author, Folliott S. Pierpoint, was born at Bath, England, and
educated at Cambridge. He was a teacher of the classics, published
several books of poems, and made notable contributions to the hymnody
of the church.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">DIX</span> appeared first in a collection of chorales edited and
published by Kocher in Stuttgart in 1838, set to the hymn &ldquo;<i>Treuer
Heiland, wir sind hier</i>.&rdquo; It has long been used with the words, &ldquo;As
with gladness men of old&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_530">530</a>), by W. C. Dix, hence the name &ldquo;Dix.&rdquo;
It has a strong, joyous tune which marches with stately tread and is
a favorite processional.</p>
<p>Conrad Kocher, 1786-1872, was a German student of church music, a
composer and teacher. He studied at St. Petersburg and in Rome.
He founded the School of Sacred Song in Stuttgart, which did much to
improve German church music and popularize four-part singing in
Germany.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_52">52. God of the earth, the sky, the sea</h3>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_53">53. Lord of all being, throned afar</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Oliver W. Holmes</i>, 1809-94</div>
<p>A hymn difficult to praise too highly, probably the greatest penned
on the omnipresence of God. Its first appearance was in the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i> as the final installment of the series of articles later collected
into book form and entitled <i>The Professor at the Breakfast Table</i>. The
work closed with the following lines and the hymn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peace to all such as may have been vexed in spirit by any
utterances these pages may have repeated! They will, doubtless,
forget for the moment the differences in the hues of truth
we look at through our human prisms and join in singing (inwardly)
this hymn to the Source of the light we all need to
lead us, and the warmth which alone can make us brothers:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord of all being! throned afar,</p>
<p class="t">Thy glory flames from sun and star;</p>
<p class="t0">Centre and soul of every sphere,</p>
<p class="t">Yet to each loving heart how near.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Oliver Wendell Holmes was the son of a Congregational minister in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, although later when he became established
as a physician in Boston, he united with the Unitarians. His writings
are nevertheless permeated by an evangelical warmth which has made
his hymns acceptable to all denominations. Holmes was a distinguished
graduate of Harvard University in Arts and Medicine and spent most
of his years teaching anatomy at Harvard. But he is best known to us
as a man of letters. None of his writings is so widely known as the
two hymns, &ldquo;Lord of all being&rdquo; and &ldquo;O Love divine, that stooped to
share&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_172">172</a>), both of them found in the author&rsquo;s <i>The Professor at the
Breakfast Table</i>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">LOUVAN</span> is by an American musician, Virgil C. Taylor,
1817-91, organist and editor of song books. This is the only one of his
tunes now in common use. An alternative tune that fits the hymn
very well is &ldquo;St. Crispin&rdquo; found at <a href="#hymn_149">No. 149</a>.</p>
<h4 class="b">HIS LOVE AND MERCY</h4>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_54">54. Be still, my soul, the Lord is on thy side</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Katharina von Schlegel, born c.</i> 1697</div>
<div class="author"><i>Tr. Jane L. Borthwick</i>, 1813-97</div>
<p>The hymn is a translation of a poem by Katharina von Schlegel.
She was born in Germany, 1697. No one seems to have found anything
definite concerning her life, except that she wrote some hymns, one of
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
which passed into the English language. The original, based on Psalm
46:10, &ldquo;Be still and know that I am God,&rdquo; had four stanzas, as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Stille, mein Wille! Dein Jesus hilft siegen;</p>
<p class="t">Trage geduldig das Leiden, die Not;</p>
<p class="t0">Gott ist&rsquo;s, der alles zum besten will f&uuml;gen,</p>

</div>
<p>The words, both in the original and in the English translation, are of
great beauty and their message has brought real comfort to many a
burdened and disquieted soul.</p>
<p>The translation is by Jane Borthwick, born in Edinburgh, who, with
her sister, Sarah B. Findlater, did outstanding work as a translator of
German hymns. Only Catherine Winkworth surpassed her. Miss Borthwick,
a member of the Free Church of Scotland, was a devout Christian
character, especially interested in the mission work of the church, both
home and foreign. Another of her well-known translations is &ldquo;My
Jesus, as Thou wilt&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_250">250</a>) from the original by Benjamin Schmolke.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">FINLANDIA</span> is from the pen of Jean Sibelius, born December
8, 1865, in Finland, and undoubtedly the greatest living composer.
At this writing, 1948, he is still living, but, through the misfortunes of
war, reduced to penury and poverty. Besides seven symphonies, he
wrote many smaller orchestral works. This tune is from the tone poem
&ldquo;Finlandia,&rdquo; the arrangement having been made for the <i>Hymnal of the
Presbyterian Church</i> in 1932. It is included in a number of recent
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
hymn books and has become a favorite with worshipping congregations
wherever introduced.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_55">55. God is love; His mercy brightens</h3>
<div class="author"><i>John Bowring</i>, 1792-1872</div>
<p>A bright, joyful hymn which we owe to a layman, Sir John Bowring,
born at Exeter, England, 1792. Though a member of the Unitarian
Church, his faith was apparently that of an evangelical. On his tombstone
are engraved the words of another great hymn which he himself
wrote, &ldquo;In the Cross of Christ I glory&rdquo; (See <a href="#hymn_110">110</a>). Bowring was the son
of a manufacturer of woolen goods and he spent his early years travelling
in all parts of the world in the interest of his father&rsquo;s business.
Though he left school at the age of 14, he became an outstanding linguist
and scholar and writer. At the age of 16, he had acquired five
languages and late in life he is said to have known 200 languages and
spoken 100. One of his primary interests was politics. He was elected
to the British Parliament and later became the British consul at Canton
and the governor of Hong Kong. He published a book of <i>Hymns</i> with
the desire that they might be useful in strengthening the religious faith
of others who under suffering and disheartening circumstances might
chance to read them.</p>
<p>The hymn is constructed to emphasize in each stanza the idea of
God as wisdom (I Cor. 1:30) and love (I John 4:8).</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">STOCKWELL</span>, a very useful tune, appeared in Lowell Mason&rsquo;s
popular collection of hymns, <i>New Carmina Sacra</i>, in 1850, set to the
words, &ldquo;Silently the shades of evening,&rdquo; written by Christopher Cox.</p>
<p>The composer, Darius Eliot Jones, 1815-81, was born at Carroll, N. Y.
His father, Abner Jones, was a well-known music teacher in New York.
Darius spent twenty years of his adult life in business. He served for
a time as assistant editor of the <i>Choral Advocate</i>, published by Mason
Brothers, New York, and at the same time conducted the music in
Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, where Henry Ward Beecher was pastor.
At Beecher&rsquo;s suggestion, Jones prepared a new hymn book, <i>Temple
Melodies</i>, 1861, for use in Plymouth Church. Feeling a call to the
Christian ministry, Jones entered Iowa College, at Davenport, as a
student and at the age of 43 was ordained as a Congregational minister.
He served churches at Columbia City and Newton Center, Ia., until
1863, when he became treasurer of the Iowa General Association. For
a year, he was agent for the American Bible Society; and for four years,
1866-70, he was agent for Iowa College, later located at Grinnell and
known as Grinnell College. Here Jones published a second hymn book,
<i>Songs for the New Life</i>, in 1869. From that time on, he served various
churches in Iowa until his death in 1881.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_56">56. How gentle God&rsquo;s commands</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Philip Doddridge</i>, 1702-51</div>
<p>This hymn, beautiful in poetic imagery, is based on I Peter 5:7,
&ldquo;Casting all your care upon Him: for He careth for you.&rdquo; When it
first appeared, posthumously, in a book of hymns by the author, it
bore the title, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s care a remedy for ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Philip Doddridge was born in London, the youngest of a family of
twenty, most of whom died in childhood. His father was an oil merchant.
Before he could read, he had learned from his mother the
stories of the Bible by the aid of Bible pictures on the Dutch tiles that
covered a portion of the living room. Doddridge became a minister in
the Congregational Church and devoted his life not only to preaching,
but to writing books and teaching young men for the ministry. In 1751,
he went to Lisbon to seek relief from tuberculosis but died there. He
is the author of over 400 hymns, a few of which have survived, and are
found in most hymn books. The <i>Hymnary</i> contains six of his compositions.</p>

<p>The hymn was written by Eliza Scudder, an American hymn writer
of the middle nineteenth century. She was born in Boston, and died in
Weston, Massachusetts. She was a niece of Edmund H. Sears, author of
&ldquo;It came upon a midnight clear&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_75">No. 75</a>). Miss Scudder was a person of
deep religious insight and lived a quiet, retiring life. She published
a book of religious verse, <i>Hymns and Sonnets</i>, in 1880. During most of
her active life she was a Unitarian, but in later life joined the Episcopal
Church.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">BALLERMA</span> (misspelled Balerma in some editions of the

<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">WELLESLEY</span> was written, by request, for the graduation
hymn of the Newton (Mass.) high school class of which Miss Tourjee
was then a member. The original tune had a slight fault in voice leading
which was corrected, with her permission, by Dr. Hamilton C. Macdougall,
then Professor of Music at Wellesley College.</p>
<p>Lizzie S. Tourjee, 1858-1913, was a student at Wellesley College during
the year 1877-78. In 1883, she married Frank Estabrook. Her
father, Dr. Eben Tourjee, encouraged her in the writing of the tune,
and named it for the new college nearby where she became a student
for one year.</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">INTEGER VITAE</span> (or <span class="small">FLEMMING</span>) was composed by Flemming
for a chorus of men&rsquo;s voices. It was set to &ldquo;Integer Vitae,&rdquo; an
ode by Horace. The tune became a great favorite with college men not
only in this country but also in England and Germany. It was introduced
as a hymn tune through the hymnals of Dr. Charles R. Robinson,
<i>Songs of the Sanctuary</i>, and <i>Laudes Domine</i>, and has since been
widely used and accepted as one of our most satisfactory hymn tunes.
It is one of the favorite tunes in the <i>Gesangbuch mit Noten</i> where it is
set to the words, &ldquo;<i>Ach mein Herr Jesu</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The composer, Frederick Ferdinand Flemming, M. D., 1778-1813, received
his training in medicine and was a successful practitioner in Berlin.
He is known to posterity, however, as a composer of part songs for
men&rsquo;s choruses, and more particularly as the composer of this tune.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_60">60. God moves in a mysterious way</h3>
<div class="author"><i>William Cowper</i>, 1731-1800</div>
<p>There is no basis, according to most hymnologists, for the story that
this hymn was written after Cowper was mysteriously prevented from
committing suicide by drowning. The hymn was published by John
Newton in the <i>Olney Hymns</i>, 1779, and rapidly became popular. It is
still found in nearly all the hymnals. Its original title was &ldquo;Light
shining out of darkness.&rdquo; Its central thought is that God is working
His sovereign will even in the mystery and perplexity of human life,
bringing light, not <i>after</i> darkness, but <i>out of</i> darkness.</p>
<p>William Cowper, 1731-1800, was the greatest English poet of his
age. He had been trained for the law and was called to the bar at the
age of twenty-three but had to retire on account of ill health. He lost
his mental balance and became deeply melancholic, a misfortune which
is attributed to cruelty received at the hands of older and stronger lads
while he attended preparatory school. After treatment in a private
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
asylum, and living for a time in the home of Rev. Morley Unwin, he
moved to Olney where his devoted friend, the Rev. John Newton was
curate. Here he assisted Newton in his parochial and evangelistic work
and collaborated with him in the production of what became known as
the <i>Olney Hymns</i>. In spite of efforts at literary work, his depression of
spirit returned and never left him, except for brief intervals, until his
death in 1800.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">DUNDEE</span> (or <span class="small">FRENCH</span>) is one of the twelve Common Tunes appearing
in the <i>Scottish Psalter, The CL Psalms of David &amp;</i>, Edinburgh,
1615, where it is named &ldquo;French Tune.&rdquo; Its first appearance in an
English Psalter is in Ravencroft&rsquo;s <i>Whole Book of Psalms</i>, 1621, where it
is called &ldquo;Dundy.&rdquo; It is one of the best known of the psalm tunes and
its smooth, flowing melody has enjoyed great popularity.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_61">61. O God, our help in ages past</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Isaac Watts</i>, 1674-1748</div>
<p>Based on Psalm 90:1-6: &ldquo;Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in
all generations,&rdquo; etc., this is Watt&rsquo;s greatest hymn and one of the greatest
in the English language. It is found in all English hymn books and
has been translated into many languages. Its smoothness, simple dignity,
and faithfulness to Scripture give it the marks of a true church
hymn, and it has probably been chosen more than any other for use
upon important occasions. It is an indispensable New Year&rsquo;s hymn.</p>
<p>A press dispatch related how the hymn was used during the Second
World War by a group of eleven doomed Norwegians as they faced a
Nazi firing squad in the village of Selbu outside of Trondheim, Norway,
for &ldquo;general hostility&rdquo; to German occupiers. &ldquo;Despite the torture
to which they had been subjected to earlier,&rdquo; writes an eye-witness,
&ldquo;the group of prisoners, linked hand in hand, proudly and firmly
faced their executioners. One of the men, Peter Morseth, who for years
led the singing in the local church, read a short prayer and was joined
by his companions in singing the hymn, &lsquo;O God our help in ages past.&rsquo;
Then the shots rang out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Wesley printed the hymn in his <i>Collection of Psalms and
Hymns</i>, 1734, altering the opening line from &ldquo;Our God, our help,&rdquo; to
&ldquo;O God, our help.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_62">62. The Lord is my Shepherd</h3>
<div class="author"><i>James Montgomery</i>, 1771-1854</div>
<p>One of the fine metrical versions that have been made of the
Twenty-third Psalm. It Is found in Montgomery&rsquo;s <i>Songs of Zion, being
Imitations of Psalms</i>, 1822. Another much-loved and widely used version
of the same Psalm is that in the <i>Scottish Psalter</i> (See <a href="#hymn_579">579</a>).</p>
<p>James Montgomery, greatest of Moravian hymn writers, was born in
Ayrshire, Scotland, near the birthplace of Robert Burns. His father
became a minister in the Moravian Church and finally went as a missionary
to the West Indies where both he and his wife died. After
spending a part of his youth in precarious and doubtful ways of living,
and failing in several business ventures, James became the editor of
<i>The Sheffield Register</i>, a position he held with honor and distinction
for thirty-one years. He was twice imprisoned for expressing liberal
political views in his paper. He is classed by the <i>literati</i> as a minor
English poet, but in the writing of hymns he ranks with Wesley,
Watts, and Doddridge. Of his 400 hymns, 100 are still in use. Eleven
of his hymns are found in the <i>Hymnary</i>, exceeded in number only by
those of Hosmer, Wesley and Watts. All of Montgomery&rsquo;s hymns show

<p>Thomas Koschat, 1845-1914, was an Austrian composer and singer.
While a student of natural science at Vienna University he sang in the
Court Opera Chorus, and soon became its leader. In 1875, Koschat
organized the K&auml;rnthner Quintet which became famous for its singing of
Carinthian folk songs. He is known for his harmonization of Carinthian
melodies and original songs in their style, for which he wrote the texts.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_64">64. Let us with a gladsome mind</h3>
<div class="author"><i>John Milton</i>, 1608-74</div>
<p>This delightful lyric is the result of John Milton&rsquo;s paraphrasing of
Psalm 136 when he was a boy of 15 years. The original has 26 stanzas.
The Psalm tells the story of Israel&rsquo;s history, ending each verse with the
refrain, &ldquo;For his mercy endureth forever.&rdquo; The selections here are his
renderings of verses 1, 2, 7, and 25. The closing stanza returns to verse 1.</p>
<p>John Milton, the poet, was born in London, the son of the John Milton,
who had turned from the Roman Catholic Church to become a
Protestant. The future poet went to Christ&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, where
he received his B.A. in 1628 and M.A. in 1632. His short poems and
paraphrases were written at an early age and constitute some of his best
work. The second period of his literary career was given almost entirely
to writings on political subjects for he lived in the day of the
controversies which led to Civil War and the establishment of the
Commonwealth in England. Milton joined Oliver Cromwell as his
secretary for foreign tongues to the Council of State, a position he held
until the eve of the Restoration, when he barely escaped the scaffold.
For years he had suffered from poor eyesight and became totally blind
in his forty-fourth year. The third period of his life, after the Restoration
of the Monarchy, was lived in close retirement. During this time
he produced his greatest writings: <i>Paradise Lost</i>, <i>Paradise Regained</i>, and
<i>Samson Agonistes</i>, all of them dictated to others. He ranks second only
to Shakespeare among English poets. He translated 19 psalms into
meter. Being the scholar&rsquo;s rather than the people&rsquo;s poet, he, however,
had no great influence on hymnology. His version of Psalm 84 is found
at <a href="#hymn_592">No. 592</a>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">INNOCENTS</span> appeared, anonymously, in the <i>Parish Choir</i>,
1850, a publication issued by members of the Oxford Movement in England
who went by the name of &ldquo;The Society for Promoting Church Music.&rdquo;
The &ldquo;Society&rdquo; laid down the following principles for singing:</p>
<p>1. Congregational singing should be in unison.</p>
<p>2. The melody should be clearly marked.</p>
<p>3. The compass should be within the natural limits of the human
voice.</p>
<p>4. Metrical psalmody should be confined to tunes in common time,
as being more simple and solemn than triple time.</p>
<p>After three years of precarious existence, 1846-49, the <i>Parish Choir</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
was discontinued. <span class="small">INNOCENTS</span> appeared at the end of Volume III
amongst a number of old psalm tunes, appointed to be sung to a hymn
for Innocents Day, hence the name. Lightwood attributes the tune to
Joseph Smith, born in 1800, near Birmingham, England. Smith was not
a professional musician but very fond of music, an excellent singer,
and composer of many hymn tunes and other pieces. The editor of
the <i>Parish Choir</i> altered the original to the present form. It made its
way into <i>Hymns Ancient and Modern</i>, 1861, and is now found in many
modern hymn books.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_65">65. Hail to the Lord&rsquo;s Anointed</h3>
<div class="author"><i>James Montgomery</i>, 1771-1854</div>
<p>A rendering of Psalm 72, made in 1821 for the Christmas worship
of a Moravian settlement. The original has eight stanzas. Montgomery
was greatly interested in missions and this hymn, generally esteemed his
finest composition, is a good missionary hymn as well as a splendid
one for the Advent season. Dr. Adam Clarke gave it wide publicity by
publishing it in his famous <i>Bible Commentary</i>, 1822, at the end of his
exposition of Psalm 72, adding this note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I need not tell the intelligent reader that he has seized the
spirit, and exhibited some of the principal beauties, of the
Hebrew bard; though (to use his own words in a letter to me)
his &ldquo;hand trembled to touch the harp of Zion.&rdquo; I take the liberty
here to register a wish, which I have strongly expressed to
himself, that he would favor the Church of God with a metrical
version of the whole book.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is interesting to compare this hymn with Isaac Watts&rsquo; rendering of
the same psalm (<a href="#hymn_341">341</a>).</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">WEBB</span>, also known as &ldquo;Morning Light,&rdquo; was composed for
a secular song, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis dawn, the lark is singing,&rdquo; and first published in
<i>Odeon: A Collection of Secular Melodies</i>, by G. J. Webb and Lowell
Mason, 1837. It first appeared as a hymn tune in <i>The Wesleyan Psalmist</i>,
1842, and later it was used for the hymn &ldquo;The morning Light is
breaking,&rdquo; in books by Mason and Webb.</p>
<p>The composer, George James Webb, 1803-87, a member of the Swedenborgian
Church, was born near Salisbury, England; studied theology
and music; came to the United States and became associated with Lowell
Mason in editing and publishing music books. He was married to
Mason&rsquo;s daughter, Mary. He played the organ at Old South Church,
Boston, and was Professor of Secular Music in the Boston Academy of

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_66">66. Watchman, tell us of the night</h3>
<div class="author"><i>John Bowring</i>, 1792-1872</div>
<p>An Advent and missionary hymn, unique in that it consists of a dialog
(between a watchman and a traveller). The hymn is based on
Isaiah 21:11, 12: &ldquo;Watchman, what of the night? watchman, what of the
night? The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night:
if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.&rdquo; The meaning of the
passage is not evident from the context. Dr. C. S. Robinson describes
the setting as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The image it presents is singularly dramatic and picturesque.
The scene is laid in the midst of the Babylonian Captivity. A
lonely watchman is represented as standing on the ramparts of
some tower along the defenses of the citadel. He seems to be
anxiously looking for the issues of the siege leveled against it.
The time is midnight. Calamity is over the land. The people
are afflicted. Their enemies are pressing them hard. That solitary
sentinel sadly remains at his post, peering into the unlit
gloom, trying to discern signs of deliverance. But the heavens
are starless, and the impenetrable clouds keep rolling on. Suddenly
an unknown voice pierces the air. Whether in wailing
sorrow or in bitter taunt, is not evident; but out of the stillness
already grown oppressive breaks the question with repetitious
pertinacity: &ldquo;Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what
of the night?&rdquo; The sentinel waits through a moment of surprised
meditation and then tranquilly answers: &ldquo;The morning
cometh and also the night; if ye will inquire, inquire ye: return,
come.&rdquo; Then the dialog lapses into silence again, and the
night gathers its unbroken shadows deeper than ever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">WATCHMAN</span> is by Lowell Mason who wrote the tune in
1830 in 3-4 time. He intended it as a duet between soprano and tenor,
with the congregation repeating the last line of each stanza (the reply
of the watchman). The tune also lends itself well to antiphonal singing.</p>

<p class="t5">Gaude, gaude; Emmanuel</p>
<p class="t5">nascetur pro te, Israel.</p>
</div>
<p>The hymn comes from the Latin, being a translation of the first of
the seven greater <i>Antiphons</i> (short anthems-verses) sung in the Roman
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
Church at Vespers on the seven days before Christmas. The refrain,
&ldquo;Rejoice, rejoice,&rdquo; etc., added to the hymn during the 13th century,
is the answer to the longing for Christ expressed in each stanza.</p>
<p>The translation of Stanza 1 is by John M. Neale, 1818-66, a Cambridge
scholar and the most noted hymnologist and liturgist of his time.
He was a minister and author of books on biblical and historical subjects,
but his fame rests chiefly on his translations of Greek and Latin
hymns. The <i>Hymnary</i> contains ten of his works.</p>
<p>The second and third stanzas were translated in 1916 by Henry
Sloan Coffin, eminent Presbyterian minister, formerly of the Madison
Avenue Church in New York City, and then for many years president
of Union Theological Seminary. He is a recognized leader in contemporary
American church life.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">VENI EMMANUEL</span>, written in the first Gregorian mode, is
an adaptation by Thomas Helmore, in 1856, of a melody said to
have been found in a French manuscript in Lisbon, which has since
disappeared. The original is believed to have been a 12th century
&ldquo;Kyrie.&rdquo; The harmony in the minor mode gives the tune its quaint
flavor. It should be sung with spirit, in keeping with the joyful anticipation
embodied in the words. It is effective with men&rsquo;s voices singing
the first part in unison, then all the voices in harmony on the refrain.
The tune also lends itself to interesting effects in antiphonal singing.</p>

<div class="author"><i>Douglas LeTell Rights</i>, 1891&mdash;</div>
<p>Written in 1915, while World War I was raging in Europe and the
clouds were gathering thick over the United States. The hymn is an
appeal for the Spirit of Christ to bring peace and light to a troubled
world. It was composed while the author, a Moravian, was a student
at the Divinity School of Harvard University. It was the custom at
that institution to have students of the School submit original compositions
of hymns, one of which would be selected to be sung at the
annual Christmas service of the school. This hymn was selected for the
Christmas of 1915.</p>
<p>Douglas LeTell Rights, born in Winston-Salem, N. C., received his
A. B. degree from the University of North Carolina and then prepared
for the ministry at the Moravian Theological Seminary, Bethlehem,
Pa., and at Harvard University. A member of the Moravian
Church, anciently called the <i>Unitas Fratrum</i>, his first pastorate was at
the First Moravian Church, Greensboro, N. C., 1916-18. In 1918-19, he
was chaplain in the army in World War I. Since 1919, he has been
pastor of Trinity Moravian Church, Winston-Salem, N. C. Rights is

<div class="author"><i>Isaac Watts</i>, 1674-1748</div>
<p>This hymn, which has such an important place in the yearly celebration
of the Nativity, is a free rendering of the latter part of Psalm
98: &ldquo;Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth: make a loud
noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.&rdquo; Watts entitled it, &ldquo;Messiah&rsquo;s Coming
and Kingdom.&rdquo; His effort to put the New Testament gospel into
the Psalm resulted in a great hymn of the Advent and Nativity, though
his free rendering nearly lost sight of the Psalm itself. He feels all
nature thrilling with joy at the Saviour&rsquo;s birth.</p>
<p>For comments on Isaac Watts see <a href="#hymn_11">Hymn 11</a>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ANTIOCH</span> is an arrangement, credited by some authorities
to Lowell Mason, from Handel&rsquo;s <i>Messiah</i>. The opening phrase resembles
the first bar of the chorus, &ldquo;Lift up your heads,&rdquo; and the four
measures set to &ldquo;and heaven and nature sing&rdquo; are reminiscent of the
introduction to the tenor recitative, &ldquo;Comfort ye my people.&rdquo; It is a
stirring tune well fitted to the words. It may be sung antiphonally to
good effect, the congregation singing lines 1 and 2 (1st score), the
choir, lines 3 and 4 (2d and 3d scores), and both choir and congregation
the refrain (last score).</p>

<p>From a longer poem of 48 lines, written about 1749, by Dr. John
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
Byrom for his daughter Dolly who, when asked what she would like
to have for a Christmas present, replied, &ldquo;Please write me a poem.&rdquo;
On Christmas morning she found on her plate at the breakfast table
a sheet of paper on which was written this poem, entitled, &ldquo;Christmas
Day. For Dolly.&rdquo; It is based on Luke 2.</p>
<p>John Byrom was born in Manchester, England, graduated from Cambridge,
studied medicine but gave up its practice in order to teach a
system of shorthand he himself had invented, and which became the
chief system of shorthand in his time. He was a friend of Charles and
John Wesley and taught them shorthand, which Charles especially put
to good use in dashing down hymns as they flashed into his mind.
Byrom was a man of learning and piety and also was given to wit and
humor. He coined the phrase &ldquo;tweedledum and tweedledee&rdquo; when the
friends of Handel and Buononcini were debating the relative merits of
the two composers:</p>
<div class="verse">

with Nicholas Brady of the <i>New Version</i> of the psalms in meter, to
which was added a supplement in 1770 containing this hymn. The
quaint and picturesque paraphrase of Luke 2:9-11, closing with the
doxology, was one of the few hymns permitted to be sung in the English
churches along with the metrical psalms. It became very popular
and has been translated into the Latin and nearly all the living languages.

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">CHRISTMAS</span> is an adaptation of a melody from Handel&rsquo;s
opera, <i>Siroe</i>. Geo. F. Handel was born in Prussia in 1685 (the same
year as J. S. Bach) and died in 1759. He lived in England 50 years and
became a naturalized English citizen. He wrote many forms of music
but is chiefly known and loved for his oratorio, <i>The Messiah</i>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ST. MARTIN&rsquo;S</span> (74), by William Tans&rsquo;ur, is less joyful than
&ldquo;Christmas,&rdquo; but the tune fits the words perfectly. Its quiet, mystic
melody suggests the serenity of the Judean hillside where shepherds
watched their flocks.</p>
<p>William Tans&rsquo;ur, 1706-85, was the son of a laborer, whose name is
spelled &ldquo;Tanzer&rdquo; in the church register. He became a teacher of psalmody,
moved from town to town to conduct singing classes, and did much
to improve psalm-singing in the Church of England. He published a
number of books on music. An eccentric man, given to self-advertisement,
he described his first volume <i>The Harmony of Sion</i>, 1734,
as &ldquo;The most curiosest Book that ever was published.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_75">75. It came upon a midnight clear</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Edmund H. Sears</i>, 1810-76</div>
<p>Published by the <i>Christian Register</i> in 1860, the hymn quickly attained
wide popularity. Edmund H. Sears was minister of a Unitarian
Church at Wayland, Mass. He wrote, &ldquo;Though I was educated in the
Unitarian denomination, I believe and preach the divinity of Christ.&rdquo;
A careful reading of the hymn reveals a fine social message. The author
was writing at a time of extraordinary unrest throughout the world,
caused in America by the passing of the Fugitive Slave Law, the great
forty-niner gold rush to California, and in Europe by the aftermath of
the revolution in France and Germany. In the stillness of the first
Christmas night, the author finds a message of healing for our restlessness,
and with Isaiah looks forward to a golden age when peace shall
reign on earth. But when will that time come? The Civil War, tragic
irony, followed in ten years! The hope, however, abides and is valid,
for peace is in the ultimate plan of God.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">CAROL</span> was composed by Richard Storrs Willis, brother of
the American poet, N. P. Willis. It is a graceful, popular tune, and is

often set to &ldquo;While shepherds watched their flock by night,&rdquo; for which
it is admirably adapted.</p>

<div class="author"><i>Traditional</i></div>
<p>&ldquo;Noel&rdquo; is a French word which came to mean several things&mdash;a &ldquo;song
of the Birthday,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Christmas,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Carol.&rdquo; A carol is a religious song
telling the story of a place or person or event. It is less formal and
solemn than an ordinary church hymn and was originally intended to
be sung outside rather than within the church walls. The words and
music of this carol are traditional, which means that no one knows who
composed them or when. They are known to have existed as early as
the 17th century. It is a very popular carol even though not quite true
to the gospel account in verse 2, for it was the wise men, not the shepherds,
that saw the star. Since most of the words have to do with the
coming of the wise men, the carol is fully as suitable for Epiphany as
for Christmas.</p>

<p>The poem was published in the <i>Presbyterian</i> about 1939. No specific
information is at hand concerning the author. Bixel, composer of the
music, is under the impression that E. Royce was a missionary to China
who sent this poem to her church paper for publication.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">SILENT</span> was composed for this carol by James W. Bixel,
who was born at Bluffton, Ohio, November 7, 1913. After graduating
from Bluffton College, Bixel studied music in Cincinnati Conservatory
of Music, where he received his Master of Music degree in composition.
He taught music in the public schools of Mt. Gilead, Ohio, and then
spent nearly four years in Civilian Public Service. In the fall of 1947
he became a teacher of harmony and piano in the music department of
Bethel College. The tune, begun and completed in one evening, has
the distinction of being the only one in the <i>Hymnary</i> composed by a
Mennonite. Which leads one to observe that our hymns and tunes, like
many other elements in our culture, are &ldquo;ours&rdquo; by appreciation and
use rather than by invention or creation. It may be the future will
find us less &ldquo;practical&rdquo; minded than heretofore and that poetic and
musical gifts will yet come to fruition to make our contribution to the
stream of hymns and tunes that have enriched the worship of the Visible
Church of all places and ages.</p>

company in Glasgow. He maintained, however, his literary interests
and wrote the <i>Life of Chatterton</i>, the poet; a book of <i>Pen Pictures
of Popular English Preachers</i>; and other works, including several
volumes of devotional poetry. He had been ill in bed on Epiphany
Day, and after reading the Gospel for the day, he wrote this hymn, finishing
it by evening. It became very popular and is found in nearly all
English hymnals. The accuracy of the second verse may be questioned&mdash;&ldquo;To
that lowly manger bed.&rdquo; For it is not likely that the babe Jesus was
still in the manger when the wise men appeared.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">CHRIST THE KING</span>, known in many hymnals as &ldquo;Greensleeves,&rdquo;

<p>A priceless legacy from the Latin Church and one of the most popular
of Christmas hymns. It has been translated into at least 125 languages.
The origin of the text and tune is obscure. The original poem
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
may have been German or French of the 17th or 18th century.</p>
<p>From the lengthy (and on the whole profitless) discussions of the
possible origins of the hymn, it may be concluded that the hymn and
tune came into use together, in the services of the Roman Church, during
the first part of the 18th century; that they were circulated first in
manuscript form and later appeared in print, the earliest known book
containing them being a small volume, <i>An Essay on the Church Plain
Chant</i>, published in London, 1782. Nothing definite can be stated as
to the authors of either words or music.</p>
<p>The translation was made in 1841 by Frederick Oakeley, 1802-80,
Church of England minister who later joined the Roman Catholics.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ADESTE FIDELES</span> belongs by long association to this hymn,
its name being derived from the first words of the Latin. It is also
widely used with &ldquo;How firm a foundation.&rdquo; The present arrangement
is credited to Vincent Novello, organist in the Portuguese Chapel
in London about 1785.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_81">81. Angels from the realms of glory</h3>
<div class="author"><i>James Montgomery</i>, 1771-1854</div>
<p>A graceful lyric presenting to the imagination a series of pictures&mdash;the
Angels, the Shepherds, the Wise Men, and the Saints who like
Simeon and Anna, were waiting for the consolation of Israel. The
fourth verse is reminiscent of the prophetic words of Malachi: &ldquo;The
Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger
of the covenant whom ye delight in: behold he shall come, saith the
Lord of Hosts&rdquo; (3:1).</p>
<p>It is widely used for the Christmas season.</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">REGENT SQUARE</span> is a jubilant, vigorous tune, composed for
the English <i>Presbyterian Hymnal</i> of 1867 in which it was set to
Bonar&rsquo;s hymn, &ldquo;Glory be to God the Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The composer, Henry Smart, 1813-79, studied law for four years and
then decided to become a musician. Though he had little formal musical
training, he became a great organist, composer, and conductor.
He became totally blind by 1865, but, being a capable improviser, and
possessing a keen memory, he was able to continue as an organist. He
did much for the cause of good music in the church.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_82">82. Angels we have heard on high</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Bishop Chadwick</i></div>
<p>A popular carol of French origin, sung first in England by the Westminster
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
Abbey Choir and for that reason it is sometimes called the
&ldquo;Westminster Carol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No information has been traced concerning Bishop Chadwick.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">GLORIA</span> is a traditional melody of anonymous composition.
The tune has been variously harmonized. This version is found
in the <i>St. Basil&rsquo;s Hymnal</i>, compiled by the Basilian Fathers, and published
in Chicago, 1918 (Revised Ed.).</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_83">83. Silent night, holy night</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Joseph Mohr</i>, 1792-1848</div>
<p>The most loved and most widely used of all Christmas carols.</p>
<p>It was composed December 24, 1818, by Joseph Mohr, 1792-1848, assistant
Catholic priest in an obscure German village, Oberndorf, near
Salzburg, Austria. At a Christmas celebration in the schoolhouse Mohr
withdrew for a time, then returned with a folded sheet of paper on
which this carol was written. He handed it to his friend, Franz Gruber,
1787-1863, schoolmaster, song writer, and organist, as a Christmas gift.
Gruber composed the tune for it the same evening. The author and
composer sang it together, the latter accompanying on the guitar, and
a choir of girls from the village joining in the melody. The hymn and
the tune became immensely popular in Germany and Austria even before
they appeared in print, through their use by wandering Tyrolese
singers. Today the carol is sung in all Christian lands. It was a favorite
of the great opera singer Madame Ernestine Schumann-Heink, and
she sang it on many of her concert appearances.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">STILLE NACHT.</span> In keeping with German custom, the tune
is named after the first line of the hymn for which it was written.</p>
<p>A plaque in the schoolhouse at Oberndorf bears the following inscription:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Stille Nacht, heilige Nacht!</p>
<p class="t0">Wer hat dich, O Lied, gemacht?</p>
<p class="t0">Mohr hat dich so schoen erdacht,</p>

</div>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_84">84. O little town of Bethlehem</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Phillips Brooks</i>, 1835-93</div>
<p>This carol was written for children, but it has become popular everywhere
with adults as well.</p>
<p>Phillips Brooks, one of America&rsquo;s greatest preachers, grew up in a
musical home where memorizing and reciting of hymns was a part
of the children&rsquo;s education. By the time he was ready for college he had
committed over 200 hymns to memory. He graduated from Harvard
and from the Episcopal Theological Seminary, Alexandria, Virginia, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
served as rector at the Church of the Advent, Philadelphia, and at
Trinity Church, Boston, where his preaching powers came to full and
fruitful fruition. In 1891, he became Bishop of Massachusetts. While in
Philadelphia, he was given a year&rsquo;s leave of absence to travel in Europe
and the Near East. In Christmas Week in 1865, he rode on horseback
from Jerusalem to Bethlehem. The view of the little town is thought
to have inspired this hymn which he wrote several years later for the
Christmas service of the Sunday school in his church.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ST. LOUIS.</span> Brooks asked his church organist, Lewis Redner,
who was also Sunday school superintendent, to set the carol to
music. This was done in great haste on the Saturday night before
Christmas, 1868. The words and tune, printed on leaflets, were sung
by six teachers and 36 Sunday school children, and then practically forgotten
until 1892 when they were published in the <i>Hymnal of the Episcopal
Church</i>. The hymn has become popular since, not only in America
but also in England. The tune generally used in England, however,
is not &ldquo;St. Louis,&rdquo; but &ldquo;Forest Green.&rdquo; (See <a href="#hymn_290">290</a>.)</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_85">85. Hark the herald angels sing</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Charles Wesley</i>, 1707-88</div>
<p>One of the most popular English hymns. Julian listed four hymns as
standing at the head of all in the English language: &ldquo;When I survey&rdquo;
(105-6), &ldquo;Rock of Ages&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_148">148</a>), &ldquo;Awake my soul&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_25">25</a>), and this one.</p>
<p>It is taken from Wesley&rsquo;s <i>Hymns and Sacred Poems</i>, 1739. The original
had 10 four-line stanzas and no refrain. The hymn has been altered
in various ways and improved. For example, the lines,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">With the angelic host proclaim,</p>
<p class="t">Christ is born in Bethlehem,</p>
</div>
<p>originally read</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Universal nature say</p>
<p class="t">Christ the Lord is born today.</p>
</div>
<p>And for our familiar first lines,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Hark! the herald angels sing!</p>
<p class="t">Glory to the new-born King,</p>
</div>
<p>Wesley had</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Hark! how all the welkin rings,</p>
<p class="t">Glory to the King of Kings.</p>
</div>
<p>These, and other changes, disprove the common assertion that hymns
should always be sung just as the authors left them. As a rule, however,
it still remains true that &ldquo;the <i>professional</i> hymn mender is an
odious creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For comments on Charles Wesley see <a href="#hymn_6">Hymn 6</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">MENDELSSOHN</span>, also called &ldquo;Bethlehem&rdquo; and &ldquo;St. Vincent,&rdquo;
is from Mendelssohn&rsquo;s <i>Festgesang</i> for Male Chorus and Orchestra,
composed in 1840 to celebrate the invention of printing. The tune
is adapted from chorus No. 2 of that work. Dr. W. H. Cummings,
organist at Waltham Abbey, set the tune to the words of this hymn
and had it sung by the Abbey Choir. It was so well received that he
published it in 1856 and it has since found its way into the hymn books
of all denominations.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note Mendelssohn&rsquo;s own estimate of the tune, as
he expressed it in a letter to his English publishers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am sure that piece will be liked very much by the singers
and hearers, but it will never do to sacred words. There must
be a national and merry subject found out, something to which
the soldier-like and buxom motion of the piece has some relation,
and the words must express something gay and popular
as the music tries to do.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_86">86. O holy night</h3>
<p>The night of the Saviour&rsquo;s birth is the subject of Christmas carols
in every land, of which this and &ldquo;Silent Night&rdquo; are outstanding examples.
The words are anonymous.</p>
<p>The omitted third stanza reads as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Truly He taught us to love one another;</p>
<p class="t">His law is love and His gospel is peace.</p>
<p class="t0">Chains shall he break for the slave is our brother,</p>
<p class="t">And in His name all oppression shall cease.</p>
<p class="t0">Sweet hymn of joy in grateful chorus raise we,</p>
<p class="t">Let all within us praise His holy name;</p>
<p class="t0">Christ is the Lord, Oh, praise His name forever!</p>
<p class="t">His power and glory evermore proclaim.</p>
<p class="t">His power and glory evermore proclaim.</p>
</div>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> The tune, <span class="small">HOLY NIGHT</span>, is by Adolphe Adam, 1803-56, distinguished
French composer of comic operas and teacher of composition.
He became a professor in the Conservatory of Music in Paris
in 1849.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_87">87. What star is this</h3>
<div class="author"><i>C. Coffin</i>, 1676-1749</div>
<p>A Latin hymn, <i>Quae stella sole pulchrior</i>, was included in the <i>Paris
Breviary</i>, 1736, and, again, in Coffin&rsquo;s <i>Hymni Sacri</i>, 1736. Charles Coffin,
rector of the University of Paris, wrote a large number of hymns,
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
&ldquo;not so much,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;to gratify the poetic Spirit as to achieve elegance
and piety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The translation is by John Chandler, 1806-76, in his <i>Hymns of the
Primitive Church</i>, 1837. Chandler was educated at Oxford and became
a minister in the Church of England. Besides making a collection of
hymns, he is the author of several biographies and volumes of devotional
literature. His translation of this hymn has passed into many
English hymn books but invariably with some alterations.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">PUER NOBIS</span> is an arrangement of a German folk tune
published by the German composer, Michael Praetorius, 1571-1621,
which he wrote in 1609. It was harmonized in 1904 by G. R. Woodward,
an English musician. It is a spirited tune and should be sung
briskly and merrily.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_88">88. Bethlehem, of noblest cities</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Prudentius</i>, 348-<i>c.</i> 413</div>
<div class="author"><i>Tr. E. Caswall</i>, 1814-78</div>
<p>Based on Matt. 2:6: &ldquo;And thou, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,
art not the least among the princes of Judah: for out of thee shall
come a governor, that shall rule my people Israel,&rdquo; and the story of
the three wise men bringing their gifts to Jesus.</p>
<p>The author, Prudentius, 348-c. 413, a Spaniard, was one of the best
and most prolific of early Latin Christian poets. He received legal
training and served as lawyer and judge in several cities. At the age
of 57 he entered a monastery and for the rest of his life was a writer
of poetry in defense of and in praise of the Christian faith. He is regarded
by some as the first really great Christian poet and was widely
read in Europe throughout the Middle Ages, Erasmus being one of his
admirers.</p>
<p>The translation is by Edward Caswall who shortly before had left the
Church of England to become a priest in the Roman Catholic Church.
Caswall was a Latin scholar and did much translating of Latin hymns.
For further comments on Caswall see <a href="#hymn_19">Hymn 19</a>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">STUTTGART</span> is adapted from a melody by Christian F. Witt
in his <i>Psalmodia Sacra</i>, published in Gotha, 1715, where it is set
to the hymn, &ldquo;<i>Sollt es gleich bisweilen scheinen</i>.&rdquo; It is a stately,
straightforward tune of simple, rhythmic pattern and is singable by
any average congregation.</p>
<p>Christian F. Witt, 1660-1716, was a court organist and later <i>Kapellmeister</i>
at Gotha. He composed a number of hymn tunes.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_89">89. From the eastern mountains</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Godfrey Thring</i>, 1823-1903</div>
<p>Based on Matt. 2:2: &ldquo;We have seen his star in the east and are come
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
to worship Him.&rdquo; Its reference to the guiding star and its missionary
emphasis fit it ideally for the Epiphany season, but the hymn may be
used appropriately on more general occasions.</p>
<p>Godfrey Thring was educated at Shrewsbury and Balliol College, Oxford,
and held various positions as minister in the Church of England.
In 1859, he succeeded his father as rector of Alford-with-Hornblotton
and in 1876, became prebendary of East Harptree in Wells Cathedral.
He published various hymn books of a high literary standard.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">PRINCETHORPE.</span> This tune, by William Pitts, 1824-1903,

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_91">91. Brightest and best of the sons</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Reginald Heber</i>, 1783-1826</div>
<p>A lovely hymn of great beauty and simplicity of form and characterized
by robust faith&mdash;&ldquo;richer by far is the heart&rsquo;s adoration.&rdquo; It was
written for the feast of Epiphany and was entitled, &ldquo;Star of the East.&rdquo;
The hymn was first published in the <i>Christian Observer</i>, 1811.</p>
<p>Heber, a hymnist of the first order, ranking with Wesley and Watts,
was governed by three ideas in his hymn writing: (1) the hymn is liturgical
and should follow the church year; (2) the hymn should follow
and supplement the sermon; (3) the hymn should be literary art.</p>
<p>For further comments on Reginald Heber see <a href="#hymn_1">Hymn 1</a>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">BRIGHTEST AND BEST</span> was composed by Rev. Joseph Francis

<p>Written as a Christmas carol but sings also of the later life of Jesus
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
in Nazareth, Galilee, and at Calvary. It was contributed to <i>The School
Hymnal</i> (Presbyterian), edited by Dr. Benson in 1899.</p>
<p>Louis Fitzgerald Benson was born in Philadelphia and educated for
the bar. After seven years of practice, he gave up law to enter Princeton
Theological Seminary and was ordained a Presbyterian minister.
He became minister of the Church of the Redeemer, Germantown,
Pa., but resigned his charge after six years, to begin his great
work as editor of hymn books and writer and lecturer on hymnology.
His book, <i>The English Hymn</i>, unfortunately out of print, has no rival
as a source of accurate information about the development and use of
English and American hymns. His <i>Studies in Familiar Hymns</i> (2 vols.)
is unexcelled. For forty years Dr. Benson rendered outstanding service
to all students of hymnology through his writings and lectures on the
subject. He composed 32 original hymns and made 16 translations from
the Latin which were published as <i>Hymns, Original and Translated</i>,
Philadelphia, 1925, in which the present hymn appears.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">BETHLEHEM</span>, also called &ldquo;Evangel,&rdquo; was composed by Gottfried
W. Fink, 1783-1846, German minister, musician, music critic,
and editor, who was appointed in 1842 to a Professorship of Music at
Leipzig. It is a joyful tune in popular style, especially suitable for
large choruses or congregations.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_93">93. O Master Workman of the race</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Jay T. Stocking</i>, 1870-1936</div>
<p>A hymn entitled, &ldquo;The Carpenter of Nazareth,&rdquo; written for young
people while the author was watching some carpenters at work in an
Adirondack Camp. It is one of a number of excellent modern hymns
concerned with the earthly life of Jesus and connecting Him with our
daily life and labor. Others are &ldquo;O Master let me walk with Thee&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_223">223</a>),
&ldquo;Where cross the crowded ways&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_222">222</a>), and &ldquo;O Son of Man, Thou
madest known&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_373">373</a>).</p>
<p>Jay T. Stocking was educated at Amherst, Yale Divinity School, and
at the University of Berlin. He was ordained in 1901, held a number
of prominent pastorates in the Congregational Church, and was made
moderator of the Congregational Council in 1934. He is the author
of several books and was a member of the Commission on International
Justice and Good Will of the Federal Council of Churches.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ST. MICHEL&rsquo;S</span> appeared in a collection of <i>Psalms and Hymns</i>,
compiled by William Gawler, and published in London around
1784 to 1789, for use of the children of an orphan asylum at Lambeth.
It was set to &ldquo;Creator Spirit, by whose aid,&rdquo; a long-meter hymn. Later
the tune was changed to common meter double. It is also known by the
names &ldquo;St. Maria,&rdquo; &ldquo;Beulah,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Woolrich Common.&rdquo; The composer
of the tune is not known. <i>The Hymnary</i> of the United Church of Canada
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
attributes it to Haydn. At No. 125 of the <i>Hymnary</i> it appears as
&ldquo;Jerusalem, Jerusalem,&rdquo; where it is erroneously attributed, in the
earlier editions, to Thomas Hastings&mdash;an error carried over from the
<i>Gesangbuch mit Noten</i>. Hastings was born at about the same time the
tune was already in print! It is possible, of course, that he made an arrangement
of the tune, and thereby getting his name associated, inadvertently,
with its composition.</p>
<p>Wm. Gawler, c. 1750-1809, was a London musician and music publisher.
In 1785, while organist at the Lambeth &ldquo;Asylum,&rdquo; a home, the
first of its kind in England, for fatherless girls, he published the book
<i>Psalms and Hymns</i>, referred to, later adding a supplement. Gawler
made other compilations of music books and also did some composing.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_94">94. Ye fair green hills of Galilee</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Eustace R. Conder</i>, 1820-92</div>
<p>A fine hymn, setting forth obedience to duty and love to God and
man as the marks of Christ&rsquo;s followers. It was contributed by the
author to the <i>Congregational Church Hymnal</i>, London, 1887.</p>
<p>Eustace Rogers Conder studied for the Congregational ministry in
Birmingham and later graduated with high honors in philosophy at
London University. For 17 years, he was minister of a Congregational
Church at Poole, where he trained students for missionary work, besides
attending to his regular duties as pastor. In 1873, he was elected
chairman of the Congregational Union of England and Wales. He
wrote several books, including <i>Outlines of the Life of Christ</i> and
<i>Sleepy Forest</i>, a book of fairy tales for children.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">STELLA</span> is from an old English melody in 6-8 time which
the children sang to &ldquo;Sweet Mary, sweet Mary, my age is sixteen.&rdquo;
About 1850, it was arranged by Henri F. Hemy, 1818-88, English organist,
for use in Catholic churches as an easy choir number. In 1875,
the tune appeared (almost note for note as in the <i>Hymnary</i>) in the Appendix
of <i>St. Alban&rsquo;s Tune Book</i>, a book of pre-Reformation hymns set
to plainsong melodies. The Appendix of the book is a treasure house
of arrangements and adaptations of singable tunes from sacred and

Day and other occasions.</p>
<p>Edward Hayes Plumptre, an English scholar and church man, was
educated at King&rsquo;s College, London, and at Oxford. He was minister
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
in various churches (Anglican) and became Professor of New Testament
Exegesis at King&rsquo;s College. He wrote many excellent books, including
the standard <i>Life of Bishop Ken</i>, and several volumes of poems.
He was appointed a member of the Old Testament Company of Revisers
of the Bible. This hymn was included in the 2d edition of his
<i>Lazarus, and other Poems</i>, from which it made its way into the hymnals.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ST. MATTHEW</span>, a psalm tune, appeared in the 6th ed.
(1708) of <i>A Supplement to the New Version of Psalms</i>, by Tate and

<div class="author"><i>Benj. R. Hanby</i>, 1833-67</div>
<p>A hymn on the birth, ministry, passion, resurrection, and exaltation
of Christ, the refrain answering the question asked in each stanza. It
may be used effectively for antiphonal singing between choir and congregation.</p>
<p>The author, Benjamin Russel Hanby, was a minister in the United
Brethren Church but was strongly inclined to music and decided to
make that his life work. An interesting and talented man, he became
associated with George F. Root in the publication of sacred and secular
song books in Chicago. He was the author of a number of Sunday
school songs and of &ldquo;Darling Nellie Gray,&rdquo; &ldquo;Old Shady,&rdquo; and other
popular numbers. His untimely death ended his career almost before
it was well begun. His father, the Rev. William Hanby, was a bishop in
the church of the United Brethren in Christ and editor, for a number

<p>Called the &ldquo;Crusader&rsquo;s Hymn,&rdquo; but there is no foundation for the
tradition that it was sung by the German knights of the 12th century
on their way to Jerusalem. The text and tune are modern. The German
text was published in <i>M&uuml;nster Gesangbuch</i>, 1677 (Catholic). Our
translation, the oldest English version, is by an unknown author, about
1850. A later translation, beginning &ldquo;Beautiful Savior,&rdquo; was made by

<i>Church Carols and Choir Studies</i> by the American composer Richard
Storrs Willis, 1850. F. Melius Christiansen, director of the St. Olaf
Choir, has arranged an exquisite anthem on this melody with the

<div class="author"><i>Frederick L. Hosmer</i>, 1840-1929</div>
<p>Based on the story of the transfiguration in Matthew 17, the lesson
enforced by the hymn is that the mount is necessary for vision; we cannot
abide there, yet our work in the valley will be nobler for the pattern
shown us on the mount.</p>

<p>A Christmas song written in 1910, while the author was a graduate
student at Harvard University. It was awarded the prize which had
been offered for the best Christmas hymn written by a student. Though
simple and unpretentious, Professor George Herbert Palmer declared
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
it &ldquo;a perfect poem.&rdquo; The few lines encompass a vast body of Christian
truth.</p>
<p>The author, Harry W. Farrington, 1880-1931 (date of death printed
erroneously as 1911 in earlier editions of the <i>Hymnary</i>), was educated
at Harvard and then became a Methodist minister. He was greatly
interested in work among children and inaugurated the Week Day
Church School at Gary, Ind., in 1914. After returning from service in
World War I, he became widely known as a speaker for children and it
is estimated that he addressed more than two million children in the
public schools of America. He is the author of several volumes of
poems and has written books on Franklin, Washington, Lincoln, and
Theodore Roosevelt.</p>

<p>From a long Latin hymn of 39 couplets, based on Psalm 24:7-10;

</div>
<p>The hymn was used as the processional in the Palm Sunday service
of the medieval church.</p>
<p>St. Theodulph of Orleans composed the words about <span class="small">A.D.</span> 820. He
was probably born in Italy, though neither the date nor place of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
birth are definitely known. Theodulph became the abbot of a monastery
in Florence but was later brought to France and made bishop of
Orleans. Emperor Louis the Pious imprisoned him on a false charge
of conspiracy in 818. There is a legend, but only a legend, that this
hymn was composed during the author&rsquo;s confinement, and that St.
Theodulph sang it at the window of his cell as the King passed the
prison on the way to church and that the latter was so moved by it
that he ordered the release of Theodulph and his restoration to his office
as bishop.</p>
<p>The translation was made by the learned John M. Neale (See <a href="#hymn_67">67</a>)
who wrote that &ldquo;another verse was usually sung, until the 17th century,
at the pious quaintness of which we can scarcely avoid a smile:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Be thou, O Lord, the rider,</p>
<p class="t">And we the little ass;</p>
<p class="t0">That to God&rsquo;s holy city</p>
<p class="t">Together we may pass.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ST. THEODULPH</span> was composed by Melchior Teschner (c.
1615), a Lutheran pastor and musician. It was originally sung to the
German chorale, <i>Valet will ich dir geben</i> (&ldquo;Farewell, I gladly bid
thee&rdquo;), a hymn for the dying. That the same tune is used to carry a
cheerful, festive hymn, as well as a hymn for the dying, illustrates the
plasticity of hymn tunes. Bach used the tune in his <i>St. John&rsquo;s Passion</i>,
and it is also associated with Gerhardt&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Wie soll ich dich empfangen</i>.&rdquo;
It is widely used as a Palm Sunday processional with St. Theodulph&rsquo;s
words. The refrain may be sung by the congregation, answering
to the verses sung by the choir. Processional hymns were almost
invariably sung that way in the medieval church and Canon Douglass
suggests that &ldquo;we should put this plan into far wider practice if we
really desire to improve our congregational singing.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_101">101. Ride on, ride on in majesty</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Henry H. Milman</i>, 1791-1868</div>
<p>A popular Palm Sunday hymn and incidentally one of the finest
poems in our hymn books. It was written by Henry H. Milman at the
age of 30, the year he was elected Professor of Poetry at Oxford University&mdash;1821.</p>
<p>Henry H. Milman was born in London, the son of Sir Francis Milman,
physician to the King. After a brilliant career at Oxford, he was
ordained at 25, appointed Professor of Poetry at Oxford at 30. Later
he became canon of Westminster and finally dean of St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral
in London, which high office he filled with distinction. He is the
author of thirteen hymns. Milman was interested, too, in drama and
wrote several plays and translated Greek plays. He is best known,
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
however, as a historian, having published <i>The History of the Jews</i> in
1829, and the <i>History of Latin Christianity</i> in 1855, both of them classics.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ST. DROSTANE</span> was written for the words &ldquo;Ride on, ride
on&rdquo; for the <i>Congregational Hymn and Tune Book</i>, London, 1862. It
has since come into wide use with this hymn. Other tunes also used
with this text are &ldquo;Winchester New&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_369">369</a>) and &ldquo;Park Street&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_272">272</a>).</p>

<h4 class="b">HIS PASSION</h4>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_102">102. When my love to God grows weak</h3>
<div class="author"><i>John R. Wreford</i>, 1800-81</div>
<p>A useful hymn, true to the Gospel record, and free from the emotional
morbidity that is found in many passion hymns.</p>
<p>John Wreford, an Englishman trained for the Unitarian ministry,
was compelled to give up his ministry on account of a failing voice.
He then opened a school at Edgbaston. The later years of his life
were spent in retirement at Bristol. The original of this hymn written
in 1837, received little notice until it was rewritten and improved by
Samuel Longfellow, brother of the more famous Henry Wadsworth.
In this revised form it has been included in a number of the best English
hymnals.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ORIENTIS PARTIBUS</span>, the so-called &ldquo;Donkey Festival Tune,&rdquo;
has a most peculiar origin. During the Middle Ages, the church
in some parts of France celebrated January 14 as the &ldquo;Feast of the Ass,&rdquo;
to commemorate the flight into Egypt. A beautiful young woman holding
a child in her arms rode a donkey through the streets of the town
and then into the principal church. The donkey, with its burden, stood
beside the high altar while mass was celebrated, during which the hymn
beginning with the line &ldquo;<i>Orientis partibus adventatis asinus</i>&rdquo; was sung.
The melody of this hymn is the basis for our tune which was adapted
by Richard Redhead and published in his <i>Church Hymn Tunes</i>, 1853.
The original was the work of Pierre De Corbeil, Archbishop of Sens,
who died in 1222. It is a virile tune worthy of its increasing place in
modern hymn books.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_103">103. &rsquo;Tis midnight and on Olive&rsquo;s brow</h3>
<div class="author"><i>William Bingham Tappan</i>, 1794-1849</div>
<p>A midnight hymn, depicting the darkness and sadness of Gethsemane.
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
It is often sung at communion services held on Thursday evening before
Good Friday.</p>
<p>William Bingham Tappan, a clock maker, was an influential leader
in Sunday school work in the Congregational Church in America. In
early manhood he taught school in Philadelphia, and then from 1826
until his death he was in the employ of the American Sunday School
Union as manager and superintendent at Philadelphia, Cincinnati, and
Boston. He wrote and published eight or ten volumes of poetry of no
special significance.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">OLIVET&rsquo;S BROW</span> was composed for this hymn and was first
published in <i>The Shawm</i>, 1853, by Bradbury and Root.</p>
<p>William Batchelder Bradbury, 1816-68, was born in York, Maine. After
many struggles, due to poverty, he learned music from Lowell Mason
and G. J. Webb and began conducting singing classes. He did outstanding
work in New York City in teaching music to children. His Juvenile
Music Festivals at the Baptist Tabernacle became an important feature
of New York&rsquo;s musical life and gave a powerful stimulus to the introduction
of music into the public schools. In 1847, he went abroad for
further study in music. Upon returning to America, he became associated
with Geo. F. Root, Thos. Hastings, and Lowell Mason in musical
Normal Institute work. The group collaborated in the production of
a new type of church music, known as gospel songs, which swept the
country during the revivalistic work of Moody and Sankey.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_104">104. There is a green hill far away</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Mrs. Cecil Frances Alexander</i>, 1823-95</div>
<p>A popular hymn on the atonement, written for children but appropriated
for general use with all ages. It was first published in the
author&rsquo;s <i>Hymns for Little Children</i>, 1848, her most famous book which
ran into 100 editions. The accuracy of the first line may well be questioned
for the Gospels do not state that Jesus was crucified on a hill,
only that it was a place called &ldquo;the skull&rdquo; (Lk. 23:33). In any case, the
sun-baked Judean hills are seldom green.</p>
<p>Cecil Frances Humphrey, daughter of Major John Humphrey, was
a native of Ireland. Her father was an Englishman who, as a landowner
and government agent, went to reside in Ireland. In 1850,
she married the Rev. Wm. Alexander who, after spending many years
in obscure parish work, was elected Archbishop of Armagh and later
Primate of all Ireland. Mrs. Alexander was pre&euml;minently a writer for
little children, her verses being characterized by simplicity and tenderness
and poetic beauty; but she also contributed some notable church
songs, e.g., &ldquo;Jesus calls us o&rsquo;er the tumult&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_140">140</a>).</p>
<p>To make the truths of the church catechism interesting and intelligible
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
to little children, Mrs. Alexander wrote a series of poems to illustrate
the Apostle&rsquo;s Creed. This hymn is on the clause &ldquo;suffered under
Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried.&rdquo; &ldquo;All things bright
and beautiful&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_410">410</a>) was written for the first clause, &ldquo;I believe in God
the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth.&rdquo; For the second
clause, &ldquo;And in Jesus Christ His Son, born of the virgin Mary&rdquo; she
wrote &ldquo;Once in royal David&rsquo;s city&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_412">412</a>).</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">MEDITATION</span> appeared in <i>Original Tunes</i>, 1890, by John
H. Gower, where it is set to &ldquo;There is a land of pure delight.&rdquo;
The tune has since become closely associated with Mrs. Alexander&rsquo;s
hymn for which it forms an appropriate setting.</p>
<p>John Henry Gower, 1855-1922, English organist and concert artist,
became professor of music at Trent College, Nottingham. Later he came
to America on account of mining interests in Colorado but maintained
his activity in music. He served as organist and choirmaster of St.
John&rsquo;s Cathedral, Denver, and during the World&rsquo;s Fair in Chicago,
1893, became organist of the Church of the Epiphany in that city.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_105">105-106. <a id="hymn_106">When</a> I survey the wondrous cross</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Isaac Watts</i>, 1674-1748</div>
<p>One of the twenty-five hymns prepared by Watts to be sung at the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper. Matthew Arnold, the famous literary critic, called it
the &ldquo;most majestic hymn in the English language.&rdquo; It is one of four
hymns which have been printed in more collections, translated into
more tongues, and used in more congregations, than any other. The
three hymns classed with this in popularity are &ldquo;Rock of Ages,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jesus,
Lover of my soul,&rdquo; and &ldquo;All hail the power of Jesus&rsquo; name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Watts gave this hymn the title &ldquo;Crucifixion to the World by the
Cross of Christ.&rdquo; It is based on Galatians 6:14: &ldquo;God forbid that I
should glory save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the
world is crucified to me, and I unto the world.&rdquo; In the first stanza
there is a reference to Phil. 3:7: &ldquo;Howbeit what things were gain to
me, these have I counted loss for Christ.&rdquo; The whole hymn, and especially
the closing stanza, reflects the thought of Galatians 2:20: &ldquo;I
have been crucified with Christ ... who loved me and gave himself
for me.&rdquo; The third stanza, a sublime picture of the suffering Saviour,
should always be sung softly.</p>
<p>For comments on Isaac Watts, see <a href="#hymn_11">Hymn 11</a>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ROCKINGHAM OLD</span> is a famous tune always used with this
hymn in England. It was named after the Marquis of Rockingham,
a Whig statesman who was thrice prime minister of England, and
a friend of the composer.</p>
<p>Edward Miller, 1731-1807, was born at Norwich, England, the son of
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
a stone mason. He was a man of great literary attainments and considerable
musical ability. For 56 years he was organist of the parish church
at Doncaster, receiving the appointment in 1751 and retaining the post
until his death in 1807. Miller played the flute in Handel&rsquo;s orchestra
in London and had many a story to tell of the great composer&rsquo;s eccentricities.
Dissatisfied with the church music of his time, he was led to
publish a book, <i>Psalms of David</i>, which turned out to be a great success.
The book contained such tunes as &ldquo;Burford&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_228">228</a>), &ldquo;St. Magnes&rdquo;
(<a href="#hymn_582">582</a>), &ldquo;St. Anne&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_61">61</a>), &ldquo;Surrey&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_44">44</a>), and others of a similar style from
the early part of the 18th century. It also contained some of his original
tunes, including <span class="small">ROCKINGHAM OLD</span>, destined to become one of the
most popular English tunes ever written. This tune was not identified
at first with any particular words. Miller had set it to 9 different
psalms, using 3 keys&mdash;F, E flat, and E. It became associated with Watts&rsquo;
&ldquo;When I survey the wondrous cross,&rdquo; in 1854, the combination appearing
in <i>Mercer&rsquo;s Church Psalter</i>, and again in 1861, in <i>Hymns Ancient
and Modern</i>. The words and tune have now become inseparable in
England.</p>
<p><span class="small">HAMBURG</span> (106), an arrangement by Lowell Mason from a Gregorian
Chant, illustrates the greatness of simplicity. The tune employs
only five tones of the scale and yet breathes the dignity and solemnity
of the great hymn to which it is set.</p>

<p>A song of the sufferings and death of Christ.</p>
<p>Gethsemane, the Judgment Hall, and Calvary are successively
brought to mind and at each stage there is found in the example of
Christ a lesson for his disciples to learn.</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">GETHSEMANE</span> is a dignified tune in the minor mode, well
adapted to carry the words of this hymn. It was composed by Christopher
Tye (c. 1508-72), a musician and minister in the Anglican
Church, of whom a contemporary document says that he is &ldquo;a doctor
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
of music but not skilful at preaching.&rdquo; He has been called the &ldquo;father
of the anthem,&rdquo; having given it a model for others to follow.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_108">108. Alas! and did my Savior bleed</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Isaac Watts</i>, 1674-1748</div>
<p>A fine hymn of consecration, published by Watts in his <i>Hymns and
Spiritual Songs</i>, 1707, under the title &ldquo;Godly Sorrow Arising from the
Sufferings of Christ.&rdquo; Dr. Charles S. Robinson states that &ldquo;more conversions
in Christian biography are credited to this hymn than to any
other.&rdquo; Fanny Crosby, the blind poet, ten of whose lyrics are found
in the <i>Hymnary</i>, credits this hymn with a share in her conversion. In
telling the story she says that during a revival in the old Thirtieth
Street Church, New York, in 1850, several times she sought the Saviour
at the altar; but not until one evening, November 20, did the light
come. &ldquo;After a prayer was offered they began to sing the good old
consecration hymn, &lsquo;Alas! and did my Saviour bleed,&rsquo; and when they
had reached the third line of the fourth stanza, &lsquo;Here, Lord, I give
myself away,&rsquo; my very soul flooded with celestial light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For comments on Isaac Watts see <a href="#hymn_11">Hymn 11</a>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">MARTYRDOM.</span> The original form of this melody is in common
time (4/4). It appeared in triple time in R. A. Smith&rsquo;s <i>Sacred
Music sung in St. George&rsquo;s Church</i>, Edinburgh, 1825, where it was
designated &ldquo;Old Scottish Melody.&rdquo; In 1827, it appeared in <i>The Seraph,
Selection of Psalms and Hymns</i>, edited by J. Robertson and published
at Glasgow. In a footnote to the tune it is stated that &ldquo;the above tune
&lsquo;Fennich,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Martyrdom,&rsquo; and by some called &lsquo;Drumclog,&rsquo; was composed
by Hugh Wilson, a native of Fennick.&rdquo; A legal dispute arose
between Smith and Wilson over the ownership of the tune. The evidence
was abundant to show that Wilson composed it. It is an effective
tune. When it was first sung in St. George&rsquo;s, Edinburgh, the minister,
Dr. Thomson, said, &ldquo;O man! I could not sing for weeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh Wilson, 1766-1824, the composer of the tune, learned his father&rsquo;s
trade of shoemaking, studied and taught mathematics, and made
sun-dials as a hobby. He then held positions of responsibility in certain
mills and afterwards became a draftsman. He was interested in
Sunday school work and wrote a number of psalm tunes but <span class="small">MARTYRDOM</span>

cross of Christ I glory,&rdquo; were placed on his tombstone.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that so great a hymn on the cross should be written
by a Unitarian, a communion which denies the deity of Jesus and the
evangelical doctrine of the atonement. Yet the hymn can be sung
whole-heartedly by every evangelical Christian for it magnifies the cross
and makes it the center of the Christian faith. Bowring, in spite of his
Unitarian connection, was a devout, evangelical believer.</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">RATHBUN</span> was composed by Ithamar Conkey, 1815-67, an
organist and prominent bass soloist who took part in many oratorio

Norwich, Conn., had preached one of a series of sermons on the &ldquo;Words

<p>The libretto of <i>The Crucifixion</i> was written by Wm. J. Sparrow
Simpson, Church of England clergyman. He was educated at Cambridge,
ordained in 1882, and became chaplain of St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital,

<p>John Stainer, 1840-1901, began his career as a choir boy at St. Paul&rsquo;s
Cathedral, London, at the age of seven, continuing there for nine years.
He early became acquainted with Arthur Sullivan and the two remained
fast friends throughout life. Stainer became one of England&rsquo;s
greatest organists and succeeded Sir John Goss, at St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral.
He was one of the most prolific and best-loved of the Victorian composers.

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_112">112. Beneath the Cross of Jesus</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Elizabeth Cecilia Clephane</i>, 1830-69</div>
<p>A hymn of Scottish origin, especially appropriate for use in Good
Friday services, but it can also be used on more general occasions.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Cecilia Douglas Clephane, daughter of the Sheriff of Fife
and Kinross, was born in Edinburgh. She was a member of the Free
Church of Scotland. Her hymn, &ldquo;There were ninety and nine,&rdquo; became
widely known through its use by Moody and Sankey in their famous
evangelistic meetings.</p>
<p>The hymn, &ldquo;Beneath the Cross of Jesus,&rdquo; appeared in Scotland,
three years after the death of Miss Clephane, in <i>The Family Treasure</i>,
a home magazine, with this explanatory note by the editor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These lines express the experiences, the hopes, and the longings
of a young Christian lately released. Written on the very
edge of this life, with the better land fully in view of faith, they
seem to us footsteps printed on the sands of Time, where
those sands touch the ocean of Eternity. These footprints of
one whom the Good Shepherd led through the wilderness into
rest, may, with God&rsquo;s blessing, contribute to comfort and direct
succeeding pilgrims.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ST. CHRISTOPHER</span> was composed for this hymn by Frederick

<p>It was written by John of Damascus about the middle of the 8th century.</p>
<p>John of Damascus, Greek theologian and distinguished hymnist, as
well as the greatest scholar and poet of his time, was born in Damascus
of a prominent family, about <span class="small">A.D.</span> 700. He was educated by an Italian
monk named Cosmas, and retired to the monastery of St. Sabas in the
Holy Land. He died between 754 and 787. He wrote a number of
canons. A canon in Greek hymnology was a series of odes, usually
eight or nine, threaded on an acrostic. This hymn is from his canon for
the Sunday after Easter.</p>

<p>Another resurrection hymn from the Eastern Church by John of Damascus.
(See <a href="#hymn_113">113</a>.) It is sung after midnight on Easter morning to set
forth the fact of the resurrection. Julian describes the service in his <i>Dictionary
of Hymnology</i> (<a class="pgref" href="#Page_62">p. 62</a>). The people assemble in the church with
unlighted tapers in their hands. While the priest chants in a half
whisper, they await the signal that Easter Day has begun. A cannon
is fired when the moment comes, the Cross is raised, and the
people cry, &ldquo;<i>Christos anesti</i>&rdquo; (Christ is risen.) The tapers are lighted
and the church is set ablaze with light. Outside there is the sound of
drums and trumpets, the people embrace and congratulate each other,
and salute one another with &ldquo;<i>Christos anesti</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the most celebrated of Easter hymns. It comes from an anonymous
medieval Latin poem which appeared in the Jesuit <i>Symphonia
Sirenum</i>, Cologne, 1695.</p>
<p>The translation is by Francis Pott, an Englishman. He was educated
at Oxford University and after serving a long number of years as
curate and rector in various churches, he retired on account of increasing
deafness. Pott published several volumes of hymns and wrote
a book on the &ldquo;<i>Te Deum</i>.&rdquo; He was a member of the original committee
which produced <i>Hymns Ancient and Modern</i>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">VICTORY</span>, also called &ldquo;Palestrina,&rdquo; is an adaptation from the
&ldquo;Gloria Patri&rdquo; of a work called, <i>Magnificat Tertii Toni</i>, 1591, by the
eminent Italian composer, Giovanni Pierluigi Sante Da Palestrina,
1525-94.</p>
<p>The present arrangement was made by Wm. H. Monk for this hymn.</p>
<p>Palestrina, foremost composer of the Roman Catholic Church and supreme
master of polyphonic music, was born at Palestrina, Italy, the
son of a wealthy peasant, Pierluigi Sante. He was named &ldquo;Da Palestrina&rdquo;
after his birthplace, a common custom in his time. He received
his musical training at Rome where he came under the powerful influence
of Orlando di Lasso, the great master from the Netherlands.
Palestrina served as chapelmaster in his home town, master of the boys
in the Julian Chapel in Rome, and in 1555 was appointed one of the
pontifical singers in the Sistine Chapel but was dismissed a few months
later when he became guilty of the &ldquo;crime&rdquo; of matrimony. He then became
chapelmaster at St. John Lateran and later of the Liberian
Chapel of Santa Maria Maggiore, during which time he became known
as &ldquo;the saviour of church music.&rdquo; Many abuses had crept into the
music of the church, particularly in the use of secular airs grafted on
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
stately church themes, and improvizations by the singers who sometimes
departed from the solemn words of the service and substituted
profane and lewd words in Italian and French. To correct this scandal,
the Ecumenical Council of Trent, in 1552, asked Palestrina to prepare
a mass free from the admixture of alien words and secular melodies,
and suitable for church use. The result was the composition of three
6-part services, one of which, <i>Missa Papae Marcelli</i>, has been regarded as
one of the most sublime creations of all music and the model of what
church music should be. As a reward for this service, Palestrina was
granted a stipend by papal decree which was not large but gave him a
sufficient income. In 1571 he was re-elected to his old post as Chapelmaster
of St. Peter&rsquo;s, where he remained for life. His fame as teacher and
composer extended throughout Europe, but his happiness was clouded
by the loss of two sons and the death of his wife in 1580, while the remaining
son, Igino, became a source of grief to him. Palestrina&rsquo;s compositions
were many and of great variety, including 93 masses, 179 motets,
hymns, prayers, responses, madrigals, etc.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_118">118. Crown Him with many crowns</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Matthew Bridges</i>, 1800-94</div>
<p>Based on Rev. 19:12: &ldquo;On his head were many crowns.&rdquo; The hymn
mentions a four-fold crowning of Christ, as: (1) Lamb upon His throne;
(2) Son of God; (3) Lord of life; (4) Lord of heaven. Two omitted
stanzas mention &ldquo;Lord of peace,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lord of years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matthew Bridges was brought up in the church of England but
became interested in the Oxford Movement and entered the Roman
Catholic Church in 1848. He was a student of history and wrote <i>The
Roman Empire under Constantine the Great</i>. He is also the author of
several books of poems. The latter part of his life was spent in the
Province of Quebec, Canada.</p>

<p>Thomas Kelly was born in Dublin, the son of an Irish judge. He at
first intended to follow his father into the legal profession, but his profound
religious convictions led him to train for the ministry. As a
young clergyman, he was summoned, with others, to appear before the
Archbishop of Dublin to answer for his evangelistic zeal. He was rebuked
and prohibited from preaching in Dublin pulpits. He then
withdrew from the Church of England and started a number of independent
churches. He was much interested in the hymnody of the
church and wrote 736 hymns in all. They are characterized by loyalty
to Jesus Christ and a deep evangelical glow.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_121">121. Rejoice, the Lord is King</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Charles Wesley</i>, 1707-88</div>
<p>A jubilant song of Christ&rsquo;s exaltation and coming in power, based
on Phil. 4:4: &ldquo;Rejoice in the Lord alway, and again I say, rejoice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hymn, in seven stanzas, appeared first in John Wesley&rsquo;s <i>Sacred
and Moral Poems</i>, 1744, and later in Wesley&rsquo;s <i>Hymns for our Lord&rsquo;s
Resurrection</i>, 1746. Though the resurrection note is in the hymn, it is
appropriate also for general occasions.</p>
<p>Charles Wesley wrote four great festival hymns: (1) &ldquo;Hark! the herald
angels sing&rdquo; for Christmas; (2) &ldquo;Christ the Lord is risen today&rdquo; for
Easter; (3) &ldquo;Hail the day that sees Him rise&rdquo; for Ascension; and (4)
&ldquo;Rejoice, the Lord is king&rdquo; for Whitsuntide.</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ARTHUR&rsquo;S SEAT</span> appeared in <i>Hymns and Songs of Praise</i>
1874, by John K. Paine and Uzziah C. Burnap. The tune is believed
to be an arrangement by Burnap from a melody composed by Sir John
Goss, 1800-80, English organist and composer of church choir music.
Handel composed a tune, &ldquo;Gopsal,&rdquo; especially for this hymn, but it is
not well known and has not found its way into many of the hymn
books.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_122">122. Hail, Thou once despis&egrave;d Jesus!</h3>
<div class="author"><i>John Bakewell</i>, 1721-1819</div>
<p>A worshipful and strongly doctrinal hymn, bringing out plainly the
doctrine of the atonement as well as the Saviour&rsquo;s enthronement and
glorification.</p>
<p>The authorship is traditionally assigned to John Bakewell, one of
John Wesley&rsquo;s lay preachers. But it is not clear that he wrote all of
it. It appeared in 1760 in a collection by M. Madan, and later, in 1776,
it was included in <i>Psalms and Hymns</i> by Augustus M. Toplady. Both
editors apparently made some changes and omissions in the hymn, resulting
in our present version.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">IN BABILONE</span> is a Dutch traditional melody, its present
arrangement having been made by Professor Julius R&ouml;ntgen, 1855-1933,
of Amsterdam. It appeared in <i>The English Hymnal</i> in 1906 and
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
has since won its way into many American hymn books. It is a joyous,
robust melody well suited to carry this hymn.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_123">123. Hark, ten thousand harps and voices</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Thomas Kelly</i>, 1769-1854</div>
<p>Based on Heb. 1:6: &ldquo;Let all the angels of God worship Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The original poem has 7 stanzas. Lowell Mason added the &ldquo;Hallelujahs&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; when he set the hymn to music. Some hymn
books have softened the &ldquo;Hallelujah&rdquo; to &ldquo;Allelujah.&rdquo; The last stanza
is a prayer for the hastening of the day when heaven and earth shall
pass away, which some may not be able to sing heartily and sincerely.</p>
<p>For comments on Thomas Kelly see <a href="#hymn_119">Hymn 119</a>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">HARWELL</span> was written for this hymn in 1840. The original
version had the men&rsquo;s voices introduce lines 5 and 6 with a dotted
eighth and a sixteenth note, in unison, while the soprano and altos observed
a quarter rest. Later editing changed the tune so all the parts
observed the quarter rest.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_126">126. Thou art coming, O my Savior</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Frances R. Havergal</i>, 1836-79</div>
<p>The first hymn Miss Havergal wrote after Advent Sunday, December
2, 1873, when she &ldquo;first saw clearly the blessedness of true consecration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances Ridley Havergal was the daughter of Rev. Wm. H. Havergal,
an Anglican clergyman who was greatly interested in the hymns
and music of the church and composed a number of tunes still in use.
His tune, &ldquo;Evan,&rdquo; is used in the <i>Hymnary</i> (<a href="#hymn_153">153</a> and <a href="#hymn_253">253</a>). Frances thus
grew up in a cultured religious environment in which hymns and
church music held a prominent place. She was handicapped by a frail
body and died at the early age of forty-three. But throughout her
short life, from the time of her confirmation at seventeen until the end,
she had an unbounded joy in Christian service. No suffering could
diminish her faith in the grace of God through Jesus Christ. Despite
her poor health, she was a devoted student of the Bible and was able
to repeat from memory the four Gospels, the Epistles, Revelations, all
the Psalms, Isaiah, and the Minor Prophets. Besides writing many letters
counselling those who sought her advice, she wrote devotional
books and composed sacred hymns and poems, always emphasizing consecration
and service. She made a considerable contribution to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
hymnody of the church. Six of her compositions are to be found in the
<i>Hymnary</i> (<a href="#hymn_126">126</a>, <a href="#hymn_190">190</a>, <a href="#hymn_215">215</a>, <a href="#hymn_219">219</a>, <a href="#hymn_296">296</a>, <a href="#hymn_380">380</a>).</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_127">127. Christ is coming, let creation</h3>
<div class="author"><i>John R. Macduff</i>, 1818-95</div>
<p>A Scottish hymn setting forth the glowing hope and expectation of
the coming of Christ in glory. It is based on Rev. 22:20: &ldquo;He which
testifieth these things saith, Surely, I come quickly. Amen. Even so,
come, Lord Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John R. Macduff was minister of the Sandyford Parish, Glasgow.
He is the author of several books of devotions and wrote numerous
hymns. His ministry at Sandyford was singularly fruitful. George
Mattheson, blind Scottish preacher, then a boy in Macduff&rsquo;s congregation,
afterwards said of him: &ldquo;Dr. Macduff gave me my first real conviction
of the beauty of Christianity.&rdquo; Macduff held strongly to the
premillennial view of the coming of Christ.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">NEANDER.</span> This famous tune has been associated with
various words. The composer first published it in 1680 set to the
hymn, &ldquo;<i>Unser Herrscher, unser K&ouml;nig</i>.&rdquo; It is also used with Schmolk&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Open now the gates of beauty&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_505">505</a>), and in England it is almost invariably
associated with &ldquo;Come, ye saints, and raise an anthem,&rdquo; by J.
Hupton and others.</p>
<p>Joachim Neander, 1650-80, whose real name was Neumann, was born
at Bremen, where he spent most of his life. As a youth he was somewhat
wild but in time became converted and associated himself with
the Pietists of Germany. He was a friend of Spener, the leader of the
Pietists. His unconventional zeal brought him into conflict with the
authorities of the Reformed Church of which he was a member, and
he was dismissed for a time from his office as teacher in the D&uuml;sseldorf
schools. Being obliged to leave town, he lived for some months in a
cave in the region of the Rhine, where he composed many of his hymns.
He is the foremost hymn writer of the German Reformed Church and
is called &ldquo;the Paul Gerhardt of the Calvinists.&rdquo; Neander, like Luther,
was a man of scholarship and accomplishment in poetry and music, as
well as theology. He wrote more than 60 hymns and composed tunes
for them.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_128">128. Ye servants of the Lord</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Philip Doddridge</i>, 1702-51</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Active Christian&rdquo; is the author&rsquo;s title of this hymn. It appeared
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
first in Job Orton&rsquo;s posthumous edition of <i>Hymns founded on Various
Texts</i>, 1755. It is founded on Luke 12:35-37:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;</p>
<p>And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord,
when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh
and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.</p>
<p>Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh
shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird
himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come
forth and serve them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doddridge, known for his sound learning and genuine Christian character,
was a first-rate hymn writer. He taught Hebrew, Greek, algebra,
trigonometry, logic, philosophy, and theology to classes of candidates
for the Congregational ministry.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_129">129. Come, Lord, and tarry not</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Horatius Bonar</i>, 1808-89</div>
<p>A plaintive, sad hymn bordering almost on pessimism, by an able,
pious author who held the doctrine of the premillenarian coming of
Christ. All his life, Bonar&rsquo;s mind was occupied with the subject of the
second advent, an interest which inspired much of his writing.</p>
<p>Horatius Bonar, born in Edinburgh, was the prince of Scottish hymn
writers. Educated at the University of Edinburgh, he was ordained in
1837 and became a minister in the Established Church of Scotland at
Kelso. At the Disruption in 1843, Bonar &ldquo;came out&rdquo; and was one of
the founders of the Free Church of Scotland (Presbyterian). Leaving
Kelso, he became the minister of Chalmer&rsquo;s Memorial Church in Edinburgh,
where he served, a greatly beloved man, until his death. He
was known as a man of wide scholarship and culture. His mind was
saturated with Scripture and his heart possessed by a broad and generous
faith.</p>
<p>His son, Rev. H. N. Bonar, wrote his father&rsquo;s <i>Life</i> which gives
some interesting information concerning his hymn writing. Bonar carried
notebooks with him in which he jotted thoughts, verses, and hymns
as they came to his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These notebooks,&rdquo; writes the son, &ldquo;contain most of the better-known
hymns, hastily written down in pencil in his spare moments.
They are full of contractions, with an occasional word or phrase in
shorthand; sometimes a line is struck out and another substituted, yet
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
in nearly every case the complete hymn, almost as it was afterwards published,
can be gleaned from this rough draft.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">SHIRLAND</span> was composed by Samuel Stanley, 1767-1822,
English composer and precentor of Carr&rsquo;s Lane Congregational Chapel,
in Birmingham. Through his skilled leadership the music of this church
became famous. The hymn singing attracted attention and resulted in
a great growth in the congregation.</p>
<p>For further comments on Stanley see <a href="#hymn_20">Hymn 20</a>.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_130">130. Lo, He comes, with clouds descending</h3>
<div class="author"><i>John Cennick</i>, 1718-55</div>
<p>A hymn on the Second Advent, based on Rev. 1:7: &ldquo;Behold He
cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which
pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him.
Even so, Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The author, John Cennick, came from a Quaker family though he
grew up in the Church of England. For some years his religious convictions
were unsettled. Then while engaged in land surveying, he
came under the influence of Wesley and became one of his lay preachers.
Later he became a follower of George Whitefield, and finally he
joined the Moravians. While limited in culture and outlook, he possessed
genuine lyric fire; and his name is of note among the hymnists,
even though only a few of his many hymns survive.</p>
<p>This hymn has been much revised. It owes not a little to Charles
Wesley who changed Cennick&rsquo;s first line, &ldquo;Lo! he cometh; countless
trumpets,&rdquo; to the familiar &ldquo;Lo, He comes with clouds descending.&rdquo;
Martin Madan, who issued the hymn in his <i>Collection of Psalms and
Hymns</i>, also gave it certain finishing touches. The hymn possesses a
scriptural vividness and impressive treatment of theme which have
carried it throughout the English speaking world, despite the apocalyptic
form of the description it sets forth.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">HOLYWOOD</span> is attributed to Samuel Webbe, probably the
elder, 1740-1816, a London organist and composer and a member of the
Roman Catholic Church. His son, Samuel Webbe, Jr., 1770-1843, following
his father in the musical profession, likewise became an organist
and composer.</p>
<p>Its solidity and triumphant note give this tune a worthy place in the
music of the church.</p>

<p>This truly great Latin hymn, addressed to the Holy Spirit, comes
from the 12th or 13th century. Its authorship is uncertain. Archbishop
Trench characterized it as &ldquo;the loveliest of all the hymns in the whole
cycle of Sacred Latin Poetry.&rdquo; Many translations have been made of it,
this one by Ray Palmer.</p>
<p>Ray Palmer, who held pastorates at Bath, Me., and Albany, N. Y., was
for a time corresponding secretary for the American Congregational
Union. His name remains the greatest among hymnists and translators
in the American Congregational church. His hymn, &ldquo;My faith looks
up to Thee&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_150">150</a>), is known all over the world.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">MALVERN</span> is from <i>The Hallelujah</i>, a series of compilations
of tunes, edited by J. J. Waite and H. J. Gauntlett, first published
in 1842. The work was intended to encourage the congregation to
sing in parts, an altogether novel principle in the English churches of
that time. To make the music easy to read, the notes were numbered,
the tonic sol-fa system having, as yet, not been developed. The present
arrangement is by John Roberts, 1822-77, Welsh Methodist pastor and
musician of extraordinary ability. He did much to improve congregational
singing in the church and was an eminent conductor of school
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>

in Ireland for a number of years, he went to London to engage
in literary pursuits. He had varied talents and became well known for
his poetry, fiction, plays, and contributed articles to magazines. In
1835, he entered parish work in London, where he was greatly admired
and loved. His outspoken utterances attracted large congregations of
all ranks to his church. He prepared, at the request of his people, a

<p>Paul Gerhardt, next to Martin Luther, is the most noteworthy hymn
writer of the Evangelical Church in Germany. Even the hymns of
Luther are not as widely used today in the English speaking world as
those of Gerhardt. He was born March 12, 1607, in Gr&auml;fenhynichen, a
village near the celebrated Wittenberg. At 21 he began the study of
theology in Wittenberg, but he received no church position until 45,
when he was ordained and appointed provost at Mittenwalde, a small
village. During his six years there, his hymns were published and he
became widely known. In 1657, he was appointed third assistant pastor
of the famous Church of St. Nicholas in Berlin. From this position he
was deposed because he refused to sign a document promising that all
clergymen would abstain from any references in their sermons to doctrinal
differences between the Lutherans and Calvinists. Though he
felt the blow keenly, he met it with Christian patience and fortitude.
&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is only a small Berlin affliction; but I am also willing
and ready to seal with my blood the evangelical truth, and, like my
namesake, St. Paul, to offer my neck to the sword.&rdquo; Additional sorrows
came into his life with the death of his wife and four of his children.
He was left with a single child, a boy of six, when he was called to the

his death on June 7, 1676. Most of his life being spent in the distractions
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>

misery and ruins, Gerhardt knew the depths of human sorrow. Out of
the depths came his hymns of comfort and hope which have been a
source of strength to a multitude of believers.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_135">135. Breathe on me, breath of God</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Edwin Hatch</i>, 1835-89</div>
<p>An earnest prayer for an inbreathing of the Holy Spirit and a greater
consecration of life. The hymn was first published in a privately
printed leaflet called, <i>Between Doubt and Prayer</i>, 1878. It is based on
John 20:22: &ldquo;He breathed on them and saith unto them, Receive ye
the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edwin Hatch, Church of England clergyman and University Reader
of Ecclesiastical History at Oxford, was a scholar of world reputation.
His Bampton Lectures, <i>The Organization of the Early Christian Church</i>,
1881, were translated into German by Prof. Adolph Harnack, who
wrote of Hatch: &ldquo;In his learning that of England&rsquo;s great old theologians,
Ussher and Pearson, lived to me again. He was a glorious man,
whose loss I shall never cease to mourn.&rdquo; Though a man of profound
learning, his faith was as simple and unaffected as that of a child.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">TRENTHAM</span> is a tune of great beauty, well fitted for these
words of devotion. The tenor part is especially melodious.</p>
<p>Robert Jackson, 1840-1914, English composer of many anthems,
hymn tunes, songs and part songs, succeeded his father as organist and
choirmaster at St. Peter&rsquo;s church, Oldham, the father and son together
having a record of continuous service at the same church for 92 years.
His whole life was devoted to music. He was a member of Sir Charles
Halle&rsquo;s orchestra and conductor of the Oldham Musical Society.</p>

two operas, two symphonies, and some piano pieces and songs&mdash;most of

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_137">137. Holy Spirit, faithful Guide</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Marcus M. Wells</i>, 1815-95</div>
<p>The hymn and tune were written by Marcus M. Wells, a farmer and
maker of farm implements who lived all his life in New York State.
Born at Otsego, N. Y., he was converted in a mission at Buffalo. Regarding
the origin of the hymn and tune he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On a Saturday afternoon, Oct. 1858, while at work in my
cornfield, the sentiment of the hymn came to me. The next
day, Sunday, being a very stormy day, I finished the hymn and
wrote a tune for it and sent it to Prof. I. B. Woodbury.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hymn sets forth God as a Presence, near the Christian&rsquo;s side,
friendly and helpful and true, guiding him through the storms and
floods and desert wastes of his pilgrimage from earth to his heavenly
home. It was first published in the <i>New York Musical Pioneer</i>, edited
by Isaac B. Woodbury.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_138">138. Our blest Redeemer, ere He breathed</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Harriet Auber</i>, 1773-1862</div>
<p>One of the finest of our hymns on the Holy Spirit. It was written
for Whitsunday and published in the author&rsquo;s <i>The Spirit of the
Psalms</i>, 1829, in seven stanzas, the second and third being omitted here.
The hymn appears in most modern hymnals and has been translated
into several languages.</p>
<p>Harriet Auber, whose grandfather went from Normandy to England
in 1685 as a Huguenot refugee, was born in London. She was a woman
of refinement and culture who spent most of her life in the quiet villages
of Broxbourne and Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire. She wrote numerous
poems and hymns, but her name survives as the author of this
exquisite lyric.</p>

<p>This is a revision by Samuel Longfellow of a hymn written by
Andrew Reed, an English Congregational minister. Reed, a philanthropist
and great organizer, and founder of six asylums and orphanages,
wrote 21 hymns and published several hymn books. He was an
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
ardent supporter of missionary work at home and abroad. Writing to
his son who suggested that the father should write his autobiography,
Dr. Reed summed up his own life in these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was born yesterday, I shall die tomorrow, and I must not
spend today in telling what I have done, but in doing what
I may for HIM who has done all for me. I sprang from the
people, I have lived for the people&mdash;the most for the most unhappy;
and the people when they know it will not suffer me to
die out of loving remembrance.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_140">140. Jesus calls us o&rsquo;er the tumult</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Cecil Frances Alexander</i>, 1823-95</div>
<p>A hymn of consecration which has had far-reaching influence especially
over young people. It is based on Matt. 4:18, 19: &ldquo;And Jesus,
walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon, called Peter,
and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.
And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of
men.&rdquo; There is also a reference to the incident by the lake recorded in
John 21:15: &ldquo;So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter,
son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hymn appeared first in <i>Hymns</i>, 1852, published by the Society
for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge. In the Episcopal Church in
the United States and Canada, it has been adopted as the hymn of the
Brotherhood of St. Andrew.</p>
<p>Mrs. Alexander is known principally as a writer of children&rsquo;s hymns
(<a href="#hymn_410">410</a> and <a href="#hymn_412">412</a>), but she also contributed excellent church songs for
adults.</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">GALILEE</span> was written for this hymn by William H. Jude,
1852-1922, English organist, composer, and lecturer on musical subjects.
The tune becomes waltz-like when sung in quick tempo. Recognizing
this danger, some hymn books are using other tunes with this
hymn.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_141">141. Behold a stranger at the door</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Joseph Grigg</i>, 1720-68</div>
<p>A lyric revealing in a remarkable manner the tenderness and love
of Christ. It is based on Rev. 3:20: &ldquo;Behold, I stand at the door and
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
knock.&rdquo; Bishop How&rsquo;s hymn, &ldquo;O Jesus Thou art standing&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_144">144</a>), with
which this may be compared, is based on the same passage.</p>
<p>Joseph Grigg, an English Presbyterian minister, began writing hymns
when only ten years old. After a brief pastorate, he retired from the
active ministry to devote himself to literary work. He published about
40 volumes, including several collections of hymns. Only two of his 43
hymns are found in modern hymnals, this one and &ldquo;Jesus, and shall
it ever be&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_192">192</a>), the latter written when he was only ten years of age.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">BERA</span>, a very useful tune, was composed by John Edgar

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_142">142. I heard the voice of Jesus say</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Horatius Bonar</i>, 1808-89</div>
<p>Based on John 1:16: &ldquo;Of his fulness have all we received, and grace
for grace,&rdquo; and originally published with the title, &ldquo;The Voice from
Galilee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hymn is constructed on three sayings of Jesus: (1) &ldquo;Come unto
me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest,&rdquo;
Mt. 11:28; (2) &ldquo;Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give shall
never thirst,&rdquo; John 4:14; (3) &ldquo;I am the light of the world; he that followeth
me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.&rdquo;
John 8:12. In the hymn, these three sayings, blended into a perfect
unity, have sounded down the ages by the &ldquo;Voice from Galilee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hymn, as C. S. Robinson reminds us, employs the personal pronoun
to emphasize the intimate relationship between Christ and the
individual. &ldquo;Christ says, &lsquo;Come to <i>me</i>,&rsquo; and the Christian says, &lsquo;<i>I</i> come.&rsquo;
Christ says, &lsquo;<i>I</i> give the living water&rsquo;; and the listener answers, &lsquo;<i>My</i>
thirst was quenched&rsquo;; Christ says, &lsquo;I am the light&rsquo;; and the child of
God replies, &lsquo;I found in him <i>my</i> Star, <i>my</i> Sun.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">VOX DELECTI</span> was composed by J. B. Dykes for this hymn
in <i>Hymns Ancient and Modern</i>, Appendix, 1868. The musical difficulties
of the tune are more apparent than real. They can be overcome
and its possibilities appreciated by careful study and practice. The first
half is written in the minor key to carry the quiet, invitational words of
Jesus. The second part, the glad acceptance of the invitation, is written
in the strongly contrasting major key.</p>

<div class="author"><i>Stephen the Sabaite</i>, 725-94</div>
<div class="author"><i>Tr. John M. Neale</i>, 1818-66</div>
<p>A restful, appealing lyric on the theme, &ldquo;Come unto me, all ye that
labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest&rdquo; Matt. 11:28.</p>
<p>It is one of the few dialog hymns. [Others are &ldquo;Watchman, tell us
of the night&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_66">66</a>), and &ldquo;Who is He in yonder stall?&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_96">96</a>)]. It may be
sung antiphonally, the choir singing the questions and the congregation
the answers.</p>
<p>Neale published this hymn in his <i>Hymns of the Eastern Church</i>, 1862,
as a translation of a Greek hymn by Stephen the Sabaite. It is a paraphrase,
however, rather than a translation.</p>
<p>For comments on John Neale see <a href="#hymn_67">Hymn 67</a>.</p>
<p>Hymnody in the Eastern Church reached its height in the 8th century.
Stephen was a nephew of John of Damascus. At the age of 10 he was
placed by his uncle in the monastery of Saint Sabas, located on a lofty
cliff overhanging the ravine of the Kidron, between Jerusalem and the
Dead Sea. Here he lived for more than half a century, known as Stephen
the Sabaite. The monastery, many of the cells cut out of solid rock,
still stands. The monks have been subjected to persecution, at various
times, at the hands of Persians, Moslems, and Bedouin Arabs, and the
monastery looks much like a fortress.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">STEPHANOS</span> was composed for this hymn by Henry W.
Baker, and was first published in the appendix of the original edition
of <i>Hymns Ancient and Modern</i>, 1868. The tune was harmonized by
W. H. Monk (See <a href="#hymn_40">40</a>).</p>
<p>Henry Williams Baker, 1821-77, was educated at Cambridge, ordained
in 1844, and served as vicar of Monkland, Herefordshire, from 1851
till his death in 1877. He was editor-in-chief of the epoch-making
book, <i>Hymns Ancient and Modern</i>, to which he contributed several of
his own hymns and tunes. As a High Churchman, he held to the doctrine
of the celibacy of the clergy and was never married.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_144">144. O Jesus, Thou art standing</h3>
<div class="author"><i>William W. How</i>, 1823-97</div>
<p>Based on Rev. 3:20: &ldquo;Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any
man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and
sup with him, and he with me.&rdquo; It was composed after the author had
been reading the beautiful poem by Jean Ingelow, entitled &ldquo;Brothers
and a Sermon,&rdquo; describing two brothers listening to an old parson in
a fishing-village church. A part of the poem is as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The parson knew that he had lost the eyes</p>
<p class="t0">And ears of those before him for he made</p>

<p class="t0">Behold!&rdquo; saith He, &ldquo;I stand at the door and knock.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Open the door with shame, if ye have sinned;</p>
<p class="t0">If ye be sorry, open it with sighs.</p>
<p class="t0">Albeit the place be bare for poverty,</p>
<p class="t0">And comfortless for lack of plenishing,</p>
<p class="t0">Be not abashed for that, but open it,</p>
<p class="t0">And take Him in that comes to sup with thee;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Behold!&rdquo; He saith, &ldquo;I stand at the door and knock!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t5">Speak, then, O rich and strong:</p>

<p class="t0">The patient foot its thankless quest refrain.</p>
<p class="t0">The wounded heart forevermore withdraw.</p>
</div>
<p>Holman Hunt&rsquo;s picture, &ldquo;The Light of the World,&rdquo; is an exquisite
illustration of the spirit of this hymn.</p>
<p>William Walsham How was born at Shrewsbury, England, educated
at Oxford, and ordained to the ministry in 1846. He served
various churches as pastor and declined offers of positions of more distinction.
He refused the bishopric of Durham, one of the most distinguished
posts in the Anglican Church, with an income more than
double what he then had. He was a man of broad sympathies and apostolical
zeal, and was a master of the pastoral art. He collaborated with
Thos. Baker Morrell in editing <i>Psalms and Hymns</i>, 1854, and in 1871
was joint editor of <i>Church Hymns</i>, published by the Society for the Promotion
of Christian Knowledge, the latter becoming the greatest rival of
<i>Hymns Ancient and Modern</i> which that book had had to date. His
poems are marked by simplicity and beauty of diction and constitute
some of the richest treasures of modern hymnody.</p>

and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.
After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise

<h4 class="b">FAITH AND VISION</h4>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_148">148. Rock of Ages, cleft for me</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Augustus M. Toplady</i>, 1740-78</div>
<p>Few hymns are more generally familiar or more treasured in the affections
of all ranks of people than this. It appeared first in the <i>Gospel
Magazine</i>, edited by Toplady, March, 1776, at the end of an article entitled,
&ldquo;A remarkable calculation Introduced here for the sake of the
Spiritual Improvements subjoined. Questions and answers relating to
the National Debt.&rdquo; The article points out that the national debt is so
large that the government will never be able to pay it off. The author
then proceeds to calculate the number of sins each human being commits.
Figuring the rate to be one per second, he arrives at this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our dreadful account stands as follows: At ten years old
each of us is chargeable with 315 millions and 360,000 sins. At
twenty, with 630 millions and 720,000. At thirty with 946 millions
and 80,000.... At eighty, with 2,522 millions and
880,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The conclusion is that the debt can only be paid by the blood of
Christ. The hymn follows his &ldquo;calculation,&rdquo; under the heading, &ldquo;A living
and dying Prayer for the Holiest Believer in the World.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For 45 years after its publication, the hymn had little acceptance in
England. Its merits then became recognized, and it became very popular.
In the last century and a quarter it has had world-wide use, in
a form altered somewhat from the original. The hymn has been criticized
for its mixed metaphors (&ldquo;cleft rock,&rdquo; &ldquo;riven side,&rdquo; &ldquo;to thy cross
I cling,&rdquo; &ldquo;to the fountain fly&rdquo;), for its false rhymes, and its over-emphasis
upon sin obsession; but it has certain heart-piercing qualities which
override all its faults. Like other hymns of the first rank (e.g., &ldquo;Jesus
Lover of my soul,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lead kindly light,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nearer my God to
Thee&rdquo;) it voices the universal need of divine help. Professor Saintsbury,
a literary critic, says of this hymn: &ldquo;Every word, every syllable, in
this really great poem has its place and meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The central imagery of the hymn is found in the following Scripture
passages: Ex. 33:22: &ldquo;While my glory passeth by, I will put thee in a
cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by&rdquo;;
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
Isa. 26:4: &ldquo;Trust ye in the Lord for ever: for in the Lord Jehovah is
the rock of ages&rdquo; (margin); I Cor. 10:4: &ldquo;and that Rock was Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A picturesque story, which originated about 1850, had it that Toplady
composed the hymn while he was sheltering from a thunder storm
in a great cleft of a limestone rock, some twelve years before the publication
of the hymn. The story is without foundation. Toplady was fascinated
by the thought of Christ as a rock and in a sermon on Isa.
42:11: &ldquo;Let the inhabitants of the rock sing,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;Chiefly may they
sing who inhabit Christ the spiritual Rock of Ages. He is a Rock in
three ways: as a Foundation to support, a Shelter to screen, and a
Fortress to protect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hymn has had a wide use among German speaking people in a
translation made by Ernst Gebhardt, 1832-99.</p>

<p>Augustus M. Toplady, born at Farnham, England, was educated at
Trinity College, Dublin. His conversion occurred at the age of 16
while on a visit in Ireland. The service was held in a barn and the
text was Eph. 2:13: &ldquo;But now, in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes were
far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.&rdquo; The preacher was an illiterate
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
but warm-hearted layman named Morris. Concerning his conversion
Toplady wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strange that I, who had so long sat under the means of grace
in England, should be brought nigh unto God in an obscure
part of Ireland, amidst a handful of God&rsquo;s people met together
in a barn, and under the ministry of one who could hardly
spell his name. Surely this is the Lord&rsquo;s doing, and it is marvelous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Toplady was ordained to the ministry of the Church of England in
1762 and in 1768 became vicar of Broadhembury. The last years of his
life were passed in London preaching in a chapel of French Calvinists.
He was a powerful preacher, and large congregations came to hear
him. A strong Calvinist, and bitterly opposed to what he considered
the reproach of Arminianism, he became involved in unfortunate controversies
with John Wesley, during which neither disputant showed
himself at his best. He died of consumption at the early age of 38.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">TOPLADY</span> was composed for this hymn by Thomas Hastings,
1784-1872. It is a popular easily sung tune, and universally used
in America with this hymn. Hastings was not a great musician and
this tune, with its &ldquo;sentimentality and rocking-chair rhythm,&rdquo; can
hardly be considered great music. But it has been a blessing to millions
of people and will doubtless continue to be sung for years to come. In
England the hymn is invariably set to other tunes and some American
hymn books have introduced alternative tunes. The tune &ldquo;Petra&rdquo;
(<a href="#hymn_109">109</a>) is used with this hymn, as is also <i>Grosser Gott wir loben Dich</i>
(<a href="#hymn_519">519</a>).</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_149">149. Strong Son of God, immortal love</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Alfred Tennyson</i>, 1809-92</div>
<p>From the prologue of Tennyson&rsquo;s great poem, &ldquo;In Memoriam,&rdquo; 1850,
containing eleven stanzas; these are 1, 4, 5, and 7, unaltered.</p>
<p>The story of &ldquo;In Memoriam&rdquo; is familiar. At Cambridge University,
Tennyson and Arthur Hallam became intimate friends. Hallam became
engaged to Tennyson&rsquo;s sister, and, after graduating from the University,
took a trip to the Continent. At Vienna, he became sick and
died, which prompted Tennyson to write the following brief but beautiful
words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;In Vienna&rsquo;s fatal walls,</p>
<p class="t0">God&rsquo;s finger touched him, and he slept.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>In 1850, seventeen years after Hallam&rsquo;s death, Tennyson published &ldquo;In
Memoriam,&rdquo; a memorial to Hallam, but also to himself as well. Among
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
the individual verses of the poem which have become immortal are
the familiar lines beginning, &ldquo;Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky.&rdquo;
(See <a href="#hymn_379">379</a>).</p>
<p>Alfred Tennyson was the son of Rev. George C. Tennyson. He
was educated at Cambridge and wrote poetry while an undergraduate.
Upon the death of Wordsworth in 1850, Tennyson was appointed
Poet Laureate. He is regarded as one of England&rsquo;s greatest poets. He
was not a hymn writer, yet several of his poems are used as hymns.
Tennyson died October 6, 1892, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ST. CRISPIN</span> was composed for the hymn &ldquo;Just as I am,
without one plea.&rdquo; The tune was used at the funeral of the composer.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_150">150. My faith looks up to Thee</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Ray Palmer</i>, 1808-87</div>
<p>This hymn was written when the author had just left Yale at the age
of 21 and was looking forward to his lifework in the Congregational
ministry. The origin of the hymn is given in Duffield&rsquo;s <i>English Hymns</i>,
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hymn was written in 1830, but not published (as a
hymn) until 1882. The author was in New York City, &ldquo;Between
his college and theological studies,&rdquo; and was in poor
health, and a teacher in a ladies&rsquo; school. Dr. Palmer says: &ldquo;I
gave form to what I felt by writing, with little effort, the stanzas.
I recollect I wrote them with very tender emotion, and
ended the last lines with tears.&rdquo; The manuscript was then
placed in a pocket-book, where it remained for some time. Its
true discoverer was Lowell Mason, the musician, who asked
young Palmer if he had not some hymn or hymns to contribute
to his new book. The pocket-book was produced and the little
hymn, then between two and three years old, and never previously
utilized, though it had been in print as a poem, was
brought to light. Dr. Mason was attracted by it, and desired
a copy. They stepped together into a store (it was in Boston),
and the copy was made and taken away without further comment.
On carefully reading the hymn at home, Dr. Mason was
so interested that he wrote for it the tune &ldquo;Olivet,&rdquo; to which it
is usually sung. Two or three days later, he again met the
author in the street, and scarcely waiting to salute him, he
said, &ldquo;Mr. Palmer, you may live many years, and do many good
things, but I think you will be best known to posterity as the
author of &lsquo;My Faith looks up to Thee.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hymn appeared first in <i>Spiritual Songs for Social Worship</i>, 1831,
by Thomas Hastings and Lowell Mason. It has been translated into
many languages on the mission fields.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">OLIVET.</span> For comments on the composer, Lowell Mason,

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_151">151. How firm a foundation</h3>
<div class="author"><i>&ldquo;K&rdquo; in Rippon&rsquo;s Selection</i>, 1787</div>
<p>A great song of faith, calling to mind such scripture passages as
Heb. 13:5: &ldquo;I will never leave thee nor forsake thee&rdquo;; Isa. 43:1, 2: &ldquo;Fear
not, for I have redeemed thee: I have called thee by thy name; thou
art mine. When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee;
and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee; when thou walkest
through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame
kindle upon thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The authorship is uncertain. The hymn appeared in <i>A Selection of
Hymns from the Best Authors</i>, 1787, edited by John Rippon, 1751-1836,
pastor of the Baptist Church in Carter&rsquo;s Lane, London, where it
was signed &ldquo;K.&rdquo; Who &ldquo;K&rdquo; was remains uncertain. The best guess seems
to be that it refers to Robert Keene, precentor in Dr. Rippon&rsquo;s church.
It is one more example of a writer sending forth an immortal song
to bless and strengthen the faith of millions, and then hiding himself
completely from public notice.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_152">152. We walk by faith, and not by sight</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Henry Alford</i>, 1810-71</div>
<p>Based on the story of the incredulity of Thomas in John 20:25-29:
&ldquo;Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger
into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not
believe ... blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Alford was educated at Cambridge for the Anglican ministry.
After serving various churches, he finally, in 1857, became Dean of Canterbury,
the highest post in the church. He was a renowned scholar
and the author of numerous volumes. His <i>Greek Testament</i> was his
greatest work and remained the standard critical commentary of the
latter 19th century. He was a member of the New Testament Revision
Company, whose work resulted in the revised version in 1881. Greatly
interested in hymnology, he himself wrote and translated many hymns,
and published several collections of hymns. Dean Alford was a strenuous
worker, never idle, always broad-minded and throughout his life
maintained cordial relations with non-conformists. A lifelong desire
to visit the Holy Land remained unfilled; which fact suggested the
beautiful inscription on his tombstone: &ldquo;<i>Deversorium viatoris proficiscentis
Hierosolymam</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the inn of a pilgrim travelling to Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ARLINGTON</span> is a tune from Thos. A. Arne&rsquo;s opera <i>Artaxerxes</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
arranged by Rev. Ralph Harrison, 1748-1810, an English
Presbyterian minister who published it in his <i>Sacred Harmony</i>, 1784.</p>
<p>Thos. A. Arne, 1710-1778, was educated for the legal profession. He
turned away from law to become the foremost English composer of the
18th century. He received his degree of Doctor of Music from Oxford
in 1759. Arne wrote the patriotic air, &ldquo;Rule Britannia,&rdquo; besides many
other popular songs. His sister, a famous contralto, was chosen by Handel
as one of the soloists for the first performance of <i>The Messiah</i>
in Dublin, April 13, 1742.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_153">153. O for a faith that will not shrink</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Wm. Hiley Bathurst</i>, 1796-1877</div>
<p>An excellent hymn on &ldquo;The Power of Faith,&rdquo; based on I John 5:4:
&ldquo;And this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.&rdquo; It
appeared in the author&rsquo;s <i>Psalms and Hymns for Public and Private Use</i>,
1831.</p>
<p>William Hiley Bathurst graduated from Oxford in 1818. During 33
years of ministry at Barwick-in-Elmet, he endeared himself to his people
by his &ldquo;eminent piety, his great simplicity of character, his tender love,
and his abundant generosity.&rdquo; He was a shy and reserved man &ldquo;and
had the peculiarity of becoming utterly silent if one asked the most
trivial question.&rdquo; His father was Charles Bragge, a member of Parliament
for Bristol. The son assumed the name of Bathurst on succeeding
to the estate of his uncle, Earl Bathurst, at Lydney Park, Gloucester.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">EVAN</span> was originally a setting by Wm. H. Havergal for a
poem by Burns, &ldquo;O Thou dread power who reign&rsquo;st above.&rdquo; Lowell
Mason took a part of the melody and arranged it, as here, for a psalm
tune, publishing it in <i>New Carmina Sacra</i>, 1850, under the name &ldquo;Eva.&rdquo;
It might be added that Havergal disapproved of the arrangement as a
&ldquo;sad estrangement.&rdquo; In spite of this, Mason&rsquo;s arrangement has remained
popular.</p>
<p>Rev. W. H. Havergal, 1793-1870, graduated from Oxford and was
ordained in the Church of England. He became the rector of a church,
but due to a carriage accident which resulted in concussion of the
brain and injury to his eyesight, he resigned his church and devoted
himself to the study of church music. In this field, he made a significant
contribution by his compositions and his efforts at purifying and
elevating the music used in the church. His daughter, Frances Ridley
Havergal (see <a href="#hymn_126">126</a>), wrote many hymns, six of which are found in the <i>Hymnary</i>.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_154">154. Faith of our fathers, living still</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Frederick W. Faber</i>, 1814-63</div>
<p>A stirring hymn of faith bringing to mind the story of the Christian
martyrs and pledging loyalty till death to the faith of our fathers. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
last stanza, suggesting the preaching of the faith through &ldquo;kindly words
and virtuous life,&rdquo; is especially fine and Christian in spirit.</p>
<p>By &ldquo;faith of our fathers&rdquo; we mean, as we sing the hymn, the truth
contained in the Gospels, taught by the Apostles, and brought again
into clear light at the Reformation. But the hymn originally, written by
a Roman Catholic, had reference to the Roman Catholic faith. The
author, an Englishman, wrote one verse as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Faith of our fathers! Mary&rsquo;s prayers</p>
<p class="t">Shall win our country back to Thee!</p>
<p class="t0">And through the truth that comes from God</p>
<p class="t">England indeed shall then be free.</p>
</div>
<p>The lines have been adapted for Protestant services to read:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Faith of our fathers! God&rsquo;s great power</p>
<p class="t">Shall soon all nations win for thee;</p>
<p class="t0">And through the truth that comes from God</p>
<p class="t">Mankind shall then be truly free.</p>
</div>
<p>The stanza, somewhat over-optimistic, is omitted from the <i>Hymnary</i>.</p>
<p>For comments on the author, F. W. Faber, see <a href="#hymn_44">Hymn 44</a>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ST. CATHERINE</span> is of English origin. The composer, Henry
F. Hemy, 1818-88, was organist at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Roman Catholic
Church in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and a teacher of piano and singing.
He wrote this tune for another hymn and published it in his <i>Crown of
Jesus Music</i>, 1864, a popular book in Catholic churches in England.
The refrain was added in an arrangement by James G. Walton, 1821-1905.</p>

<div class="author"><i>Tr. Edward Caswall</i>, 1814-78</div>
<p>&ldquo;This may well be called the sweetest and most evangelical hymn
of the Middle Ages.... It breathes the deepest love to Christ, as
the fountain of all peace and comfort, and the sum of all that is pure
and lovely.&rdquo;&mdash;Philip Schaff.</p>
<p>It is from the famous medieval hymn &ldquo;<i>Jesu, dulcis memoria</i>,&rdquo; which
David Livingstone used to repeat as he explored Africa: &ldquo;That hymn of
St. Bernard, on the name of Christ, although in what might be termed
dog-Latin, pleases me so: it rings in my ears as I wander across the wide,
wide wilderness.&rdquo; Its beauty has charmed many others who are familiar
with the Latin. The original poem has fifty quatrains, of which our
hymn is a selection of the following five:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>

<p>It is usually attributed to Bernard of Clairvaux (See <a href="#hymn_539">539</a>), but many
authorities now question the authorship. Percy Dearmer says in <i>Songs
of Praise Discussed</i> that &ldquo;it is not by St. Bernard.... St. Bernard of
Clairvaux was born 1091 and the poem itself has been found in a
manuscript of the 11th century.&rdquo; In further commenting on the authorship
he says, &ldquo;We really know nothing and are not likely to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arthur Henry Messiter, 1834-1916, born in Somersetshire, England,

New York City. Three years later this famous church appointed him
their director of music and organist, a position he held with distinction
for 31 years. He is the author of several notable books on music and

<p>Many of the stories concerning the origin of this hymn, such as that

<p>The simplicity and literacy art of the hymn are unsurpassed. Of the
188 words in the four stanzas of the hymn generally used, all but 31
are monosyllables. The hymn has been translated into virtually every
language and uncounted millions have found it a source of help in
time of need. Henry Ward Beecher once said: &ldquo;I would rather have
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
written that hymn than to have the fame of all the kings that ever sat
upon the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the annotated edition of the <i>Book of Common Praise</i>, 1909, the
following story is given:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A party of Northern tourists were on the deck of an excursion
steamer, on the Potomac, one summer evening in 1881.
One of the party, who had a remarkable voice, began to sing
hymns to the others. When he had sung two verses of &ldquo;Jesu,
lover of my soul,&rdquo; a stranger made his way from the outskirts
of the crowd: &ldquo;Beg your pardon, sir, but were you actively engaged
in the late war?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir, I fought under General
Grant.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the first speaker continued, &ldquo;I did my fighting
on the other side, and I think I was very near you one bright
night eighteen years ago this month. It was much such a night
as this. If I am not mistaken, you were on guard-duty. We of
the South had sharp business on hand. I crept near your post
of duty, my weapon in my hand; the shadows hid me. Your
beat led you into the clear light. As you paced back and forth
you were singing that same hymn. I raised my gun and aimed
at your heart&mdash;and I had been selected for the work because I
was a sure shot. Then out upon the night floated the words:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Cover my defenceless head</p>
<p class="t0">With the shadow of thy wing.</p>
</div>
<p>Your prayer was answered. I couldn&rsquo;t fire after that. And
there was no attack made upon your camp that night. I felt
sure, when I heard you singing this evening, that you were the
man whose life I was spared from taking.&rdquo; The singer grasped
the hand of the Southerner and said: &ldquo;I remember the night
very well, and the feeling of depression with which I went
forth to my duty. I knew the post was one of great danger.
I paced my lonely beat, thinking of home and friends and all
that life holds dear. Then the thought of God&rsquo;s care came to
me with peculiar force, and I sang the prayer of my heart and
ceased to feel alone. How the prayer was answered I never
knew until this evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">MARTYN.</span> The composer of this tune, Simeon B. Marsh,
1798-1875, spent many years teaching singing classes in and near Albany,
N. Y., travelling constantly on horseback from town to town
through Albany Presbytery. It was while enroute on his weekly circuit,
one day during the autumn of 1834, that the melody took form. He
alighted from his horse and wrote the music which he set to a hymn by
John Newton, &ldquo;Mary to her Saviour&rsquo;s tomb.&rdquo; Thomas Hastings later
set the tune to &ldquo;Jesus, Lover of my soul,&rdquo; a combination now deeply
imbedded in the affections of the American Church.</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">HOLLINGSIDE</span> (<a href="#hymn_159">159</a>) is the tune composed by John B.
Dykes, 1823-76, especially for this hymn. The tune has more of musical
interest than the better known &ldquo;Martyn,&rdquo; and many hymnals give it
first place for use with this hymn. Dykes was always particular about
the naming of his tunes, often some incident in his life supplying the
name. &ldquo;Hollingside&rdquo; was the name of the cottage he lived in, while
precentor at Durham, when he wrote this. Regarding its composition,
one of his sisters wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some scenes during that visit will live forever in my memory.
As, for instance, one calm Sunday evening, when I sat in
the verandah in the deepening twilight and heard, through the
open window, my brother composing and playing over the
tune &ldquo;Hollingside,&rdquo; to the words &ldquo;Jesu, Lover of my soul.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_160">160. Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah</h3>
<div class="author"><i>William Williams</i>, 1717-91</div>
<p>A superb hymn of guidance in which the analogies of the history of
Israel in the wilderness appear in every stanza and almost in every
line. It was written in Welsh in 1745 and translated into English in
1771 by Rev. Peter Williams, friend of the author and fellow-worker.
Some think stanzas 2 and 3 were translated by the author himself or by
his son, the Rev. John Williams.</p>
<p>The hymn in Welsh, with its unpronounceable words, is as follows:</p>

<p>William Williams was the chief hymn writer of Wales and one of her
greatest poets. He at first was in training for the medical profession
but after attending some revival services, decided to become a minister.
On account of his evangelical views (and his interest in evangelistic
work), he came in conflict with church dignitaries, resulting in his withdrawal
from the Established Church, and throwing himself into evangelistic
work. His preaching itineraries took him throughout Wales.
He travelled an average of 3,000 miles per year for 50 years. He wrote
many hymns, stirring the nation, influencing its character, and deepening
its faith. Williams was to Wales what Paul Gerhardt was to Germany
and Isaac Watts to England.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">DISMISSAL</span> was composed for the hymn &ldquo;Lord, dismiss
us with Thy blessing&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_45">45</a>).</p>
<p>The composer, William Letton Viner, 1790-1867, was a student of
Charles Wesley, Jr. He was organist at St. Michael&rsquo;s Church, Bath, for
18 years and at St. Mary&rsquo;s Penzance for 21 years. In 1859, he came to
the United States. He composed organ and church music and songs,
and edited several hymnals.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_161">161. Jesus, Savior, pilot me</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Edward Hopper</i>, 1818-88</div>
<p>A beautiful hymn suggested by the seafaring life. It was published
anonymously in <i>Sailors&rsquo; Magazine</i>, 1871, and again in the <i>Baptist Praise
Book</i>, 1871, and in C. S. Robinson&rsquo;s collection of <i>Spiritual Songs</i>, 1878.
The author of the hymn, unknown for several years, was discovered at
the anniversary of the Seamen&rsquo;s Friend Society, held at the Broadway
Tabernacle, New York City, May 10, 1880. Dr. Edward Hopper, popular
pastor of the Church of the Sea and Land in New York, having been
asked to write a special hymn for the occasion, brought instead, &ldquo;Jesus
Savior, pilot me,&rdquo; not aware that the hymn had already been published
in several church hymnals. The public learned then for the first time
the real authorship of the hymn. The original has six stanzas, this being
a selection of 1, 5, and 6.</p>
<p>Edward Hopper was born in New York City. He graduated from
New York University and then prepared himself at Union Theological
Seminary, New York, for the Presbyterian ministry. For many years he
was pastor of the Church of the Sea and Land in New York, which
sailors attended in large numbers.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">PILOT</span>, universally sung and beautifully adapted to these
words, was written just before the composer sailed for Europe a short
while before his death. He played the tune on the piano the night
before he embarked on shipboard for his last earthly voyage.</p>

<div class="author"><i>John Henry Newman</i>, 1801-90</div>
<p>A prayer for light and guidance, written on Sunday, June 16, 1833,
while the author, travelling for his health, was lying, sick in mind and
body, on the deck of a sail vessel that was becalmed for a whole week
in the Straits of Bonifacio, in the Mediterranean Sea. Newman was
going through a period of great heart-searching because of the disturbed
conditions in England, both in church and state. His depressed feelings
were accentuated by the wretched state of his health. The hymn
deserves its wide popularity, for it expresses the universal longing for
divine help in time of deep depression. The meaning of &ldquo;kindly light&rdquo;
was never explained by the author. To some it represents the Inward
Light of conscience; to others just the divine guidance; but to most
people it doubtless means Christ as the Light of the World.</p>
<p>John Henry Newman was born in London, the son of a banker. His
parents were devout nonconformists and brought up their son in the
evangelical faith. After a distinguished career at Trinity College, Oxford,
Newman was ordained in the Church of England, and became the
vicar of the Oxford University Church, a post he filled with distinction
from 1828 to 1843. His charm of personality and pulpit eloquence
made him a profound influence at the University. Newman became a
leader in the Oxford Movement and finally, in 1845, after a period
of much hesitation, he left Anglicanism to unite with the Roman
Catholic Church. His <i>Apologia pro Vita Sua</i>, a masterpiece of autobiography,
constitutes a powerful defense of the Roman system of belief.
In 1879, after some years of neglect by the church, he was made
a cardinal. His fine Christian character, and spiritual force, as well as
his literary ability, were universally recognized. Newman was a great
Englishman and a great saint though referred to by some writers as an
&ldquo;angel who lost his way.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">LUX BENIGNA</span> was written for these words by J. B. Dykes.
Dykes told a friend that the tune came to him while walking
through the Strand in London. The tune is also known as &ldquo;St. Oswald.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A friend visiting Cardinal Newman said to him of &ldquo;Lead, Kindly
Light&rdquo;: &ldquo;It must be a great pleasure to you to know that you have
written a hymn treasured wherever English speaking Christians are to
be found: and where are they not found?&rdquo; To which Newman, after
thoughtful silence, replied: &ldquo;Yes, deeply thankful, and more than
thankful: but you see it is not the hymn, but the tune, that has gained
the popularity! The tune is Dykes&rsquo;, and Dr. Dykes was a great master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For comments on J. B. Dykes see <a href="#hymn_1">Hymn 1</a>.</p>
<p><span class="small">SANDON</span> was also written for this hymn. It appeared in <i>The
Church and Home Metrical Psalter and Hymnal</i>, 1860, edited by Purday
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
himself. It is simpler in form than <span class="small">LUX BENIGNA</span> and is an effective
and desirable alternative tune.</p>
<p>Charles Purday, 1799-1885, the composer, was at one time a noted
singer in London. He became a publisher of music and was a popular
lecturer on musical subjects.</p>

<p>A hymn on the journey of life, entitled by the author, &ldquo;Prayer for

<p>William Henry Burleigh was brought up on a farm at Plainfield,
Conn. At the age of 25, he went to Pittsburgh, Pa., and learned the
printing trade and journalism. He later became editor of the <i>Christian
Freeman</i>, an abolitionist journal, at Hartford, Conn. He was an ardent
temperance reformer and advocate of the abolition of slavery. His last
appointment was harbour master at New York, a post he held for 15
years. Burleigh belonged to a distinguished group of Unitarians who
have contributed to American hymnody. His wife, Celia Burleigh, was
for some time minister of the Unitarian Church at Brooklyn, Conn.,
and wrote the <i>Life</i> of her husband.</p>

<p>This hymn for travellers by air was created to meet the new day of
amazing development which has taken place in modern travel. It is a
welcome addition to the hymnody of travel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Richard Roberts, born in Wales, in 1874, is an eminent preacher.
Before going to Canada where he became the first Moderator of the
United Church of Canada, he occupied pulpits in Wales, London, and
Brooklyn. He is one of the founders of the &ldquo;Fellowship of Reconciliation.&rdquo;
His views on the relation of the church to war are well expressed
in his own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The world order in which war is inherent, the church exists
to transform. When it supports the method of war, an end-product
of the unredeemed world order, the church is not only
proclaiming its own failure, but is hauling down its own flag
and hoisting instead the flag of the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">MORWELLHAM</span> was composed by Charles Steggall, 1826-1905,
an English musician who was educated at the Royal Academy of
Music in London and then for half a century was chief professor of

than any teacher in England. Steggall was an enthusiast for
the music of Bach and served as honorary secretary of the Bach Society.
He composed anthems and church music and had a lifelong interest
in hymnology. He succeeded W. H. Monk as musical editor of

<div class="author"><i>and others</i></div>
<p>A paraphrase of Genesis 28:20-22: &ldquo;And Jacob vowed a vow, saying,
If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will
give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my
father&rsquo;s house in peace; then shall the Lord be my God: and this stone,
which I have set for a pillar, shall be God&rsquo;s house: and of all that thou
shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hymn has undergone certain changes and additions so that it
really is a composite production, the details of which need not be enumerated
here. Ours is the Scottish version found in the <i>Scottish Paraphrases</i>,
1781. In Scotland it is the best-loved of the paraphrases as
&ldquo;The Lord&rsquo;s My Shepherd&rdquo; is the best-loved of the psalms.</p>

<div class="author"><i>Paul Gerhardt</i>, 1607-76</div>
<div class="author"><i>Tr. John Wesley</i></div>
<p>A hymn of the love of Christ, suited especially well for the Communion
Service. This great hymn by Paul Gerhardt first appeared in
Cr&uuml;ger&rsquo;s <i>Praxis Pietatis Melica</i>, Berlin, 1653, in sixteen stanzas. John
Wesley, great revivalist and eminent translator of German hymns, rendered
the entire hymn into English, in a different meter, and published
it in <i>Hymns and Sacred Poems</i>, 1739. Our hymn consists of the first
three stanzas, the original of which are as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Jesu Christ, mein sch&ouml;nstes Licht,</p>
<p class="t">Der du in deiner Seelen</p>
<p class="t0">So hoch mich liebst, dass ich es nicht</p>

<p class="t">Mit Lieben und Verlangen</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p class="t0">Und als dein Eigentum</p>
<p class="t">Nur einzig an dir hangen!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">

<p class="t">Als deine Liebe wohne;</p>
<p class="t0">Gib, dass ich deine Lieb&rsquo; erw&auml;hl&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t">Als meinen Schatz und Krone!</p>
<p class="t0">Stoss alles aus, nimm alles hin,</p>
<p class="t">Was dich und mich will trennen</p>
<p class="t">Und nicht g&ouml;nnen,</p>
<p class="t0">Dass all mein Mut und Sinn</p>

</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Wie freundlich, selig, s&uuml;ss und sch&ouml;n</p>
<p class="t">Ist, Jesu, deine Liebe!</p>
<p class="t0">Wo diese steht, kann nichts bestehn,</p>
<p class="t">Das meinen Geist betr&uuml;be;</p>
<p class="t0">Drum lass nichts andres denken mich,</p>
<p class="t">Nichts sehen, f&uuml;hlen, h&ouml;ren,</p>
<p class="t">Lieben, ehren</p>
<p class="t0">Als deine Lieb&rsquo; und dich,</p>
<p class="t">Der du sie kannst vermehren!</p>
</div>
<p>The prayer for the realization of the love of Christ was answered
abundantly in Wesley&rsquo;s own life. In his <i>Plain Account of Christian
Perfection</i>, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the beginning of the year 1738, as I was returning from
Savannah, the cry of my heart was</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O grant that nothing in my soul</p>
<p class="t0">May dwell but Thy pure love alone.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>On May 24 of the same year, in the Society Meeting in Aldersgate
Street, about a quarter before nine, during the reading of
Luther&rsquo;s Preface to the Epistle to the Romans, I felt my heart
strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone,
for Salvation; and an assurance was given me that He had
taken away my sins, even <i>mine</i>, and saved <i>me</i> from the law of
sin and death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wesley became interested in the German chorales through his contact
with the Moravians. In 1735, he and his brother Charles Wesley
set sail for Georgia. Among their fellow passengers on the boat were
26 Moravians who made much of the singing of hymns and seemed to
meet every storm and trial with unfaltering faith. Wesley was so impressed
that on the third day out he began the study of German and
soon joined in the daily worship of the Moravians. The fervor and
spontaneity of their singing made an indelible impression on his mind.
He later translated a number of chorales into English. (See <a href="#hymn_246">246</a>, <a href="#hymn_508">508</a>,

<p>Henry Baker (not to be confused with Henry W. Baker), 1835-1910,
son of Rev. James Baker, was educated as a civil engineer and spent
many years in his profession on railroad work in India. He loved

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_172">172. O love divine, that stooped to share</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Oliver Wendell Holmes</i>, 1809-94</div>
<p>One of Holmes&rsquo; best hymns to which he gave the title, &ldquo;Hymn of
Trust.&rdquo; It is found in the author&rsquo;s <i>Poems</i>, 1862. It was first published
as one of the poems in <i>The Professor at the Breakfast Table</i>, where it
was represented as having been heard by the professor as he walked
by a sick room. The little refrain, &ldquo;Thou art near,&rdquo; is based on Psalm
119:151: &ldquo;Thou art near, O Lord; and all thy commandments are
truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oliver Wendell Holmes, American poet and man of letters, was the
son of Rev. Abiel Holmes, a Congregational minister. He graduated
from Harvard in 1829, studied medicine at home and abroad, and became
Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at Dartmouth in 1838. He
was elected to the same chair at Harvard in 1847, a position he filled
with distinction for 35 years. During all his years of teaching he was
also engaged in literary work and published many volumes. Holmes
was chief founder of the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>. He was a member of the
Unitarian Church though in later years he fell back for spiritual comfort
on the great evangelical hymns of Watts and Wesley, finding in
them a source of satisfaction and power which the hymns of his own
denomination failed to supply. His son, Oliver Wendell, Jr., became
an eminent member of the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_173">173. Immortal Love, forever full</h3>
<div class="author"><i>John Greenleaf Whittier</i>, 1807-92</div>
<p>One of the great hymns on the living presence and sympathy of
Christ. It is taken from the poem, &ldquo;Our Master,&rdquo; of 38 stanzas, of which
this hymn is a selection of stanzas 1, 5, 13, 14, and 16 of the original.</p>
<p>John Greenleaf Whittier, the &ldquo;Quaker Poet,&rdquo; was born near Haverhill,
Mass., where he began life as a farm boy and village shoemaker.
At the age of 20, with only a limited education, he entered the profession
of journalism, largely as the result of becoming acquainted
with William Lloyd Garrison. He became editor of the <i>American
Manufacturer</i> in 1828, and of the <i>New England Review</i> in 1830. In
1836 he became the secretary of the American Anti-Slavery Society and
editor of its official organ, the <i>Freeman</i>. Whittier was a staunch advocate
of the freedom of slaves, and as a Quaker, he was just as strongly
opposed to war. His poems are characterized by wide sympathy and a
fervent love for God and man. Though a staunch Quaker, wearing
the distinctive garb and using the Quaker mode of speech all his life,
there was no narrow sectarianism in his heart. A letter written to
friends in Whittier, California, a city named after the poet, for the
dedication of the Protestant Episcopal Church at that place, illustrates
his large-hearted religious views:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I see the good in all denominations, and hope that all will
be represented in the settlement; ... diligent in business
and serving the Lord, not wasting strength and vitality in
spasmodic emotions, not relying on creed and dogma, but upon
faithful obedience to the voice of God in the soul. I see
your town is spoken of as an orthodox Quaker colony. I hope
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
there will be no sectarian fence about &ldquo;Whittier,&rdquo; but that
good men, irrespective of their creeds, will find a home there.
Nothing would be worse for it than to have the idea get abroad
that anything like intolerance and self-righteousness was its
foundation. I am gratified to know that the people of the town
which bears my name will remember me on my birthday. I
watch its growth with great interest. It has the reputation
among all who have seen it that it occupies one of the loveliest
sites in California, and that in a moral and religious and educational
point of view it need</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">SERENITY</span> is taken from a larger work entitled, <i>Waft ye
winds</i>. Though the tune is named &ldquo;Serenity,&rdquo; the composer&rsquo;s life was
anything but serene; he was the world&rsquo;s most restless and most picturesque
composer. William Vincent Wallace, 1812-65, son of an Irish
bandmaster, became a brilliant violinist. He loved adventure and
travel and made successful concert tours to Australia, the South Sea
Islands, India, South America, Mexico, the United States, and elsewhere.
Wallace spent 14 years in Germany composing piano music
chiefly, but also writing a number of operas. On account of failing
health, he abandoned writing, and went to New York where he lost all
his fortune through the failure of a piano factory. Undiscouraged by
this disaster, he once more resumed his career as composer, returned to
London, and then on doctor&rsquo;s orders went to the Pyrenees where he
died at the age of 51.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_174">174. Gracious Spirit, Holy Ghost</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Christopher Wordsworth</i>, 1807-85</div>
<p>Written for one of the pre-Lenten Sundays (<i>Quinquagesima</i>), the
lesson for the day being I Corinthians 13. It is a fine enough hymn,
but no poet can render this great paean of praise of love into verse to
equal in poetic beauty the English of the King James Version.</p>
<p>Christopher Wordsworth was a nephew of the poet William Wordsworth.
He was a brilliant student and a good athlete. After graduation
from Cambridge, he became Head Master of Harrow for a time,
then minister of a church where he proved to be a model parish priest,
and later was appointed Bishop of Lincoln. Among his writings are a
<i>Commentary on the Bible</i>, and a book of devotional poetry, <i>The Holy
Year</i>, prepared for use in public worship.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">CAPETOWN</span> is an adaptation of a melody in &ldquo;<i>Vierstimmiges
Choralbuch herausgegeben von Dr. F. Filitz</i>,&rdquo; Berlin, 1847. It
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
was originally set to the hymn, &ldquo;<i>Morgenglanz der Ewigkeit</i>&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_554">554</a>).</p>
<p>The composer, Friedrich Filitz, 1804-76, was a musician and editor
of German chorale books. He spent all his life in Munich except the
years 1843-47 in Berlin.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_175">175. O Love that wilt not let me go</h3>
<div class="author"><i>George Matheson</i>, 1842-1906</div>
<p>A song of joyful resignation, love, and trust, born out of the author&rsquo;s
experience of suffering. The story has been circulated that the hymn
was written after the woman whom Matheson loved gave him up because
of his becoming blind&mdash;a good story with one defect, <i>viz.</i>, that
it isn&rsquo;t true. It could not be true because Matheson became blind at
15 and the hymn was not written until he was 40 years old.</p>
<p>The author&rsquo;s own account of the composition of the hymn is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My hymn was composed in the manse of Innellan, on the
evening of June 6, 1882. I was at that time alone. It was the
day of my sister&rsquo;s marriage, and the rest of the family were
staying over night in Glasgow. Something had happened to
me, which was known only to myself, and which caused me
the most severe mental suffering. The hymn was the fruit of
that suffering. It was the quickest bit of work I ever did in my
life. I had the impression rather of having it dictated to me by
some inward voice than of working it out myself. I am quite
sure that the whole work was completed in five minutes, and
equally sure that it never received at my hands any retouching
or correction. The Hymnal Committee of the Church of Scotland
desired the change of one word. I had written originally
&ldquo;I climb the rainbow in the rain.&rdquo; They objected to the word
&ldquo;climb&rdquo; and I put in &ldquo;trace.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>George W. Matheson, son of a wealthy merchant in Glasgow, was an
able and greatly honored minister in the Presbyterian Church of Scotland.
He was educated at Glasgow University and licensed to preach
when 24 years old. During his University course, and all the rest of
his life, he had to depend on the eyesight of others, which makes his
accomplishments all the more remarkable. He was a brilliant student
and became a distinguished preacher and pastor. At St. Bernard&rsquo;s
Church, Edinburgh, he served a membership of over 2,000, never neglecting
his duties of pastoral calling in which he was invariably accompanied
by his devoted sister. He was a scholar of distinction and
was the author of 25 books, including such well-known works as
<i>Representative Men of the Bible</i>, <i>Representative Women of the Bible</i>,
<i>The Spiritual Development of St. Paul</i>, and a book of <i>Sacred Songs</i>. Of
the many hymns he wrote, several have been used in hymn books but
only this one has gained universal popularity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ST. MARGARET</span> was written one summer day as the composer
was sitting by the sea on the island of Arran and reading over
Matheson&rsquo;s verses. The tune came to him suddenly and he hastened to
the house where he was staying where (in his own words): &ldquo;I wrote the
music straight off, and I may say that the ink of the first note was
hardly dry when I finished the tune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The composer, Albert Lister Peace, 1844-1912, was organist at Glasgow
Cathedral and at the time he wrote this tune, he was music
editor of the revised <i>Scottish Hymnal</i> of 1885.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_176">176. For common gifts we bless Thee, Lord</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Charlotte M. Packard</i></div>
<p>A hymn of gratitude for the common gifts too often taken for
granted&mdash;the physical senses, the air, sun, darkness and sleep, the courtesies
of friendship, etc. The last stanza is a prayer for unforgetful
gratitude.</p>
<p>Information regarding the author, Charlotte M. Packard, has not
been traced. The hymn was taken from <i>Hymns of the Spirit</i>, 1937,
Boston.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ILLSLEY</span> appeared in <i>A Sett of New Psalm Tunes in Four
Parts by John Bishop</i>, c. 1700, where it is set to Psalm 100.</p>
<p>John Bishop, the composer, 1665-1737, was an English musician who
became organist of Winchester College in 1695 and in 1729 was appointed
organist of Winchester Chapel. He is buried in the Cloisters
of the College with the following epitaph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vir singulari probitate, integerrima vita, moribus innocuis,
musicaeque scientiae bene peritus, qui, postquam huic Collegio

1737, Aetat. 72. (A man of unexampled honesty, purest life,
blameless morals, and of excellent skill in music, who, after
serving this College diligently for 42 years, passed tranquilly
to the Celestial Choir on the 19th of December <span class="small">A.D.</span> 1737,

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_177">177. My God, I thank Thee, who hast made</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Adelaide Anne Proctor</i>, 1825-64</div>
<p>A hymn of pure gratitude, expressing thankfulness even for the trials
of life. It is equally useful for the sick and the well.</p>
<p>Adelaide Anne Proctor was born in London, the daughter of Bryan
W. Proctor, known in literary circles as &ldquo;Barry Cornwall.&rdquo; She possessed
extraordinary intellectual power and was specially gifted in
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
music and language. Miss Proctor contributed lyrics to <i>Household
Verses</i>, edited by Chas. Dickens, who wrote with admiration of her
verse making, her mental resources, humor, and works of beneficence.
At 38 years of age her physical strength weakened and then
followed 15 weary months of helplessness during which, however, she
maintained her old cheerfulness with never a trace of depression or
regret. She was brought up in the Church of England, but at the age
of 26 united with the Roman Catholics. Her broad sympathies and
deep religious convictions placed her above the dogmas of any one communion
and enabled her to express the aspirations of all God&rsquo;s children.
Besides her hymns, Miss Proctor is best known as the author of
the popular song, &ldquo;The Lost Chord,&rdquo; set to music by Arthur Sullivan.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">WENTWORTH</span> was composed for this hymn in <i>The Bristol
Tune Book</i>, 2d series; 1876. The middle section of the tune, lines
3 and 4, passes from the Key of C to A minor, D major and G
major, making an effective contrast to the opening and closing lines,
in the key of C.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_178">178-9. <a id="hymn_179">Love</a> divine, all loves excelling</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Charles Wesley</i>, 1707-88</div>
<p>The hymn appeared in the curiously named collection, <i>Hymns for
those that seek and those that have Redemption in the Blood of Christ</i>,
1747, and was entitled &ldquo;Jesu, show us Thy salvation.&rdquo; It dwells upon
the thought of God as love, an idea not too common in the early hymns.
The thought of the hymn is complete without stanza 2 and many hymnals
omit it. Some have objected to this stanza because of the line,
&ldquo;Take away our power of sinning.&rdquo; Literally interpreted this would
be a prayer to have taken away the power of free moral choice, which
is hardly what Wesley intended. To obviate this difficulty, the line has
been changed to &ldquo;Take away the <i>love</i> of sinning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For comments on Wesley see <a href="#hymn_6">Hymn 6</a>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">BEECHER</span> was composed by John Zundel, 1815-82, German-American
organist and composer who rendered distinguished service
as minister of music in the Plymouth Congregation Church, Brooklyn,
of which Henry Ward Beecher was pastor. He assisted Beecher
in the production of the famous <i>Plymouth Collection</i> of hymns published
in 1855. The tune, now known throughout the world, was named
after the great pulpiteer.</p>
<p><span class="small">SONATA</span> (179) is an adaptation of the theme-melody in Mozart&rsquo;s
piano Sonata No. 16, where it is marked, <i>Andantino grazioso</i>. Dudley
Buck writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, 1756-91, composed 972 pieces
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
of which we know. He is considered the greatest composer
the world has ever seen, judged by the versatility and power of
his genius. In every sort and kind of composition he was
equally excellent. Beside being a great composer he was also a
great performer, being the most accomplished pianist of his
day. He was also an excellent player on the violin.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_180">180. Pray when the morn is breaking</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Mrs. Jane Cross Simpson</i>, 1811-86</div>
<div class="author"><i>and others</i></div>
<p>A hymn setting forth the idea of prayer in a very simple way.</p>
<p>Jane Cross Simpson was the daughter of James Bell, a Glasgow attorney.
In 1837, she married her cousin J. B. Simpson, of Glasgow. At
the age of 20, she had written a poem, &ldquo;Go when the morning shineth,&rdquo;
which, after some revision, had become popular. When <i>Songs of
Praise</i>, an important English hymnbook, was in the making, this poem
was again revised to make the present hymn. The &ldquo;others&rdquo; referred to
are responsible for the revision and according to <i>Songs of Praise Discussed</i>
consisted of Percy Dearmer, Stephen Gwynn, Mabel Dearmer,
and Jan Struther.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">MEIRIONYDD</span> is a vigorous tune of easy rhythm, on the
pattern of many Welsh tunes except that the last two lines, instead
of being simple repeats of the first two lines, as in the majority of such
melodies, are varied imitations of them.</p>
<p>The composer, William Lloyd, 1786-1852, a Welshman, was a self-educated
man. Though a cattle-dealing farmer, he possessed an excellent
voice and had a considerable knowledge of music. He held singing
meetings and conducted music classes in Wales.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_181">181. Dear Lord and Father of mankind</h3>
<div class="author"><i>John Greenleaf Whittier</i>, 1807-92</div>
<p>A song of quietude and peace, reflecting the inner life of the &ldquo;Quaker
Poet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The verses are from a poem called, &ldquo;The Brewing of Soma,&rdquo; in which
Whittier tells of a certain sect of devotees in India who drank intoxicating
liquor brewed from the Soma plant. The drinking of it brought
them to a state of intoxicated excitement in which they imagined they
were god-possessed. The poet then points out how among Christians
emotional excitement is often mistaken for spiritual power.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_182">182. Sweet hour of prayer</h3>
<div class="author"><i>William W. Walford</i></div>
<p>One of the most popular of all modern prayer meeting hymns, sometimes
erroneously ascribed to Fanny Crosby. It was composed in 1842
by Rev. William W. Walford, a blind minister of England, of whom
little is known except that he recited the words of this hymn to Rev.
Thos. Salmon, Congregational minister at Coleshill, England, who
wrote them down and later sent them to the New York <i>Observer</i>, in
which publication they were printed September 13, 1845. The original
has four stanzas, the last two being omitted here.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">CONSOLATION</span>, a tune well suited to the words, was composed

<div class="author"><i>Richard C. Trench</i>, 1807-86</div>
<div class="author"><i>Arr. W. P. Merrill</i>, 1867&mdash;</div>
<p>A hymn of the peace and power available through the practice of
prayer. It is an arrangement of Trench&rsquo;s sonnet on &ldquo;Prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard Chenevix Trench was born in Dublin, educated at Twyford
School, Harrow, and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was preacher,
poet, professor of divinity and later the Archbishop of Dublin.
Trench, a scholar of distinction, is the author of valuable books, including
<i>Notes on the Parables</i>, <i>Notes on the Miracles</i>, and <i>Study of
Words</i>.</p>
<p>The poem came into the hymn books through the arrangement
made of it by Dr. W. P. Merrill who first became acquainted with the
sonnet through hearing it read about 1907 by President Charles Cuthbert
Hall, of Union Theological Seminary in the course of a lecture at
the University of Chicago. As sonnets each have fourteen lines, changes
were necessary to make the poem suitable for singing. Dr. Merrill
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
omitted two lines and arranged the rest to make three symmetrical
four-line stanzas.</p>
<p>William Pearson Merrill was born in Orange, N. J., January 10, 1867.
After graduating from Rutgers College, he trained for the Presbyterian
ministry at Union Theological Seminary, New York. He served churches
in Philadelphia and Chicago and then went, in 1911, to the Brick
Presbyterian Church in New York City to begin a long and distinguished
pastorate which ended with his retirement in 1938. He was
president of the Church Peace Union, was long active in The American
Hymn Society, and is the author of several books. His influence as
preacher and religious leader extends beyond his own denomination.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">FFIGYSBREN</span>, known in Wales as &ldquo;Clod&rdquo; (Praise), is a
tune of simple construction, but when sung rather slowly it is remarkably
powerful and effective. It appeared in America in <i>The Harvard
University Hymn Book</i>, edited by Archibald T. Davidson in 1926. It is
one of an increasing number of Welsh tunes which are becoming available
to enrich our hymnody with the element of unique beauty and
fervor that is so characteristic of the singing of the Welsh people.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_184">184. Prayer is the soul&rsquo;s sincere desire</h3>
<div class="author"><i>James Montgomery</i>, 1771-1854</div>
<p>A classic poem on prayer, written in 1818 at the request of the Rev.
E. Bickersteth for his <i>Treatise on Prayer</i>. In 1825 it was published in
<i>The Christian Psalmist</i>, headed, &ldquo;What is Prayer?&rdquo; The original has
eight stanzas of which our hymn is a selection of 1, 2, 4, 5. Prayer is
more, to be sure, than &ldquo;the soul&rsquo;s sincere desire,&rdquo; for we sincerely desire
many things that are in conflict with God&rsquo;s will. But taken as a
whole, the poem is an elaborate description of the nature of prayer and
teaches its principles and practice with truth and power. The last
stanza, unfortunately omitted in the <i>Hymnary</i>, is itself a beautiful, direct
petition:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Thou by whom we come to God,</p>
<p class="t">The Life, the Truth, the Way,</p>

<div class="author"><i>Joseph Scriven</i>, 1820-86</div>
<p>A spiritual song of comfort and hope and the most popular Canadian
contribution to the hymnody of the church.</p>
<p>The authorship of this hymn long remained a secret. In one publication
it was erroneously attributed to Horatius Bonar. Scriven composed
it for his mother to comfort her in time of special sorrow, not
intending that anyone else should see it. This information was revealed
to a friend who sat up with the author in his last illness.</p>
<p>Joseph Scriven, born in Dublin, came to Canada at the age of 25
and settled first at Rice Lake and later at Port Hope, Ontario. He was
unmarried and lived with several families in succession. An eccentric
person, he was always assisting others, and was known as &ldquo;the man who
sawed wood for widows and sick people who are unable to pay.&rdquo; He
was found drowned in a stream near Rice Lake. A monument to his
memory was erected by the people who had been helped by him, and by
others in the district.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ERIE</span> was composed for this hymn by Charles Crozat Converse,
1832-1918, an American, trained in Germany for the musical
profession. On returning to America, he studied law, graduating from
Albany Law School in 1861, and from 1875 practicing the legal profession
at Erie, Pa. He maintained his interest in music and published
several compositions during his career as lawyer.</p>

<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
to the words and added the refrain, was the pastor. Concerning the
hymn, Mrs. Hawks wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever my attention is called to it I am conscious of great
satisfaction in the thought that I was permitted to write the
hymn, &ldquo;I need Thee every hour,&rdquo; and that it was wafted out
to the world on the wings of love and joy, rather than under
stress of a great personal sorrow, with which it has so often
been associated in the minds of those who sing it.</p>
<p>I remember well the morning ... when in the midst of
the daily cares of my home ... I was so filled with the sense
of nearness to the Master that, wondering how one could live
without Him either in joy or pain, these words, &ldquo;I need Thee
every hour,&rdquo; were ushered into my mind, the thought at once
taking full possession of me....</p>
<p>For myself the hymn was prophetic rather than expressive of
my own experience at the time it was written, and I do not understand
why it so touched the great throbbing heart of humanity.
It was not until long years after, when the shadow
fell over my way&mdash;the shadow of a great loss&mdash;that I understood
something of the comforting in the words I had been permitted
to write and give out to others in my hours of sweet security
and peace.</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">NEED.</span> The tune was written for this hymn. The composer,
Rev. Robert Lowry, 1826-99, was born in Philadelphia and educated
at Bucknell University. After a few years in the Baptist ministry
he became Professor of Rhetoric at his alma mater. The University
gave him his doctorate in 1875. He resigned his chair in 1875 and the
following year resumed the work of the ministry at Plainfield, N. J.,
continuing until his death. Though he had no serious training in
music, Lowry wrote many tunes and edited several popular collections
of hymns. He did much to encourage the gospel song movement
in America.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_193">193. Stand up, stand up for Jesus</h3>
<div class="author"><i>George Duffield, Jr.</i>, 1818-88</div>
<p>A hymn of the Christian warfare, widely known, and found in nearly
all English hymn books. The origin of it is best given in the author&rsquo;s
own words in a leaflet printed in Detroit, 1883, and quoted by his
son, Samuel Duffield, in <i>English Hymns</i>, 1886:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Stand up for Jesus&rdquo; was the dying message of the Rev.
Dudley A. Tyng, to the Young Men&rsquo;s Christian Association,
and the ministers associated with them in the Noon-Day Prayer
Meeting, during the great revival of 1858, usually known as
&ldquo;The Work of God in Philadelphia.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>A very dear personal friend, I knew young Tyng as one of
the noblest, bravest, manliest men I ever met; not inferior in
eloquence to his honored father, and the acknowledged leader
of a campaign for Christ that has become historical. The Sabbath
before his death he preached in the immense edifice
known as Jaynes&rsquo; Hall, one of the most successful sermons of
modern times. Of the five thousand men there assembled, at
least one thousand, it was believed, were &ldquo;the slain of the
Lord.&rdquo; His text was Exodus 10:11, and hence the allusion in
the third verse of the hymn.</p>
<p>The following Wednesday, leaving his study for a moment,
he went to the barn floor, where a mule was at work on a
horse-power, shelling corn. Patting him on the neck, the sleeve
of his silk study gown caught in the cogs of the wheel, and his
arm was torn out by the roots! His death occurred in a few
hours. Never was there greater lamentation over a young man
than over him, and when Gen. 50:26 was announced as the
text for his funeral sermon, the place at once became a
Bochim, and continued so for many minutes.</p>
<p>The following Sunday the author of the hymn preached
from Eph. 6:14, and the above verses were written simply as
the concluding exhortation. The superintendent of the Sabbath-school
had a fly-leaf printed for the children&mdash;a stray copy
found its way into a Baptist newspaper&mdash;and from that paper
it has gone in English, and in German and Latin translations
all over the world. The first time the author heard it sung outside
of his own denomination, was in 1864, as the favorite song
of the Christian soldiers in the Army of the James.</p>

all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of
that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that
place to sleep. And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up
on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold
the angels of God ascending and descending on it.... And
Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that
he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and
poured oil upon the top of it. And he called the name of that
place Bethel.</p>

she married William B. Adams, an engineer and inventor, in 1834.
She was a member of a Unitarian congregation in London. A woman
of fine intellect, she wrote much prose and verse, and was a friend of
Robert Browning. She died of tuberculosis, contracting the disease
while caring for her sister, Eliza, who had fallen victim to the same
disease two years earlier.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">BETHANY</span> was written by Lowell Mason for this hymn.
Its resemblance to the tune of the well-known &ldquo;Oft in the stilly night&rdquo;
has been noted. The tune to this hymn was played by the ship&rsquo;s band
on board the &ldquo;Titanic&rdquo; as the vessel sank on its maiden voyage, Sunday,
April 14, 1912, after colliding with an iceberg in the Atlantic. 1635
passengers were lost, ending life&rsquo;s voyage with the strains of the familiar

<div class="author"><i>Horatius Bonar</i>, 1808-89</div>
<p>Entitled, &ldquo;Intercession for All Conditions of Men,&rdquo; in Bonar&rsquo;s <i>Hymns
of Faith and Hope</i>, 3d series, 1867.</p>
<p>The history of this hymn is given by the author&rsquo;s son, Rev. H. N.
Bonar, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My father was asked to provide words to the music, and was
especially requested to furnish a fitting refrain to the two lovely
lines of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s with which Callcott&rsquo;s tune, &ldquo;Intercession,&rdquo;
ends. In searching for a Scripture theme containing
some reiterated phrase almost of the nature of a refrain, he
was struck with Solomon&rsquo;s prayer at the dedication of the
temple (2 Chron. 6) in which every separate petition concludes
with substantially the same words.</p>
<p>This idea was taken for his starting point, and Solomon&rsquo;s
words, &ldquo;Hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place and forgive,&rdquo;
became the familiar couplet:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Hear then in love, O Lord, the cry</p>
<p class="t0">In heaven, thy dwelling place on high.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>This foundation once provided, the rest of the hymn was
built upon it.</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">INTERCESSION</span> was composed by William H. Callcott, 1807-82,
an English musician. He was organist of Ely Chapel, Holborn, and
afterwards of St. Barnabas&rsquo; Church, Kensington, and composed anthems
and songs.</p>
<p>The refrain is from Mendelssohn&rsquo;s oratorio, <i>Elijah</i>, part of the prayer
for rain by the prophet and the people. Bonar&rsquo;s hymn was written for
this tune.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_204">204. Lord, I hear of show&rsquo;rs of blessing</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Elizabeth Codner</i>, 1824-1919</div>
<p>Based on Gen. 27:34: &ldquo;Bless me, even me also, O my Father,&rdquo; and
Ezek. 34:26: &ldquo;There shall be showers of blessing.&rdquo; It is an especially
useful hymn at revival meetings.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Codner was the wife of Rev. David Codner, a clergyman of
the Church of England. She engaged in some literary work and was
much interested in the Mildmay Protestant Mission in North London.</p>
<p>The author has given the origin of the hymn as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A party of young friends over whom I was watching with
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
anxious hope attended a meeting in which details were given
of a revival work in Ireland. They came back greatly impressed.
My fear was lest they should be satisfied to let their
own fleece remain dry, and I pressed upon them the privilege
and responsibility of getting a share in the out-poured blessing.
On the Sunday following, not being well enough to get out, I
had a time of quiet communion. Those children were still on
my heart, and I longed to press upon them an earnest individual
appeal. Without effort words seemed to be given to me,
and they took the form of a hymn. I had no thought of sending
it beyond the limits of my own circle, but, passing it on to
one and another, it became a word of power, and I then published
it as a leaflet. Of its future history I can only say the
Lord took it quite out of my own hands. It was read from pulpits,
circulated by tens of thousands, and blessed in a remarkable
degree. Every now and then some sweet token was sent to
cheer me in a somewhat isolated life, of its influence upon
souls. Now it would be tidings from afar of a young officer
dying in India and sending home his Bible with the hymn
pasted on the flyleaf as the precious memorial of that which
brought him to the Lord. Then came the story of a poor outcast
gathered into the fold by the same means. Then came to
me a letter given me by Mr. E. P. Hammond, which he had received,
and in which were the words: &ldquo;Thank you for singing
that hymn &lsquo;Even Me,&rsquo; for it was the singing of that hymn that
saved me. I was a lost woman, a wicked mother. I have stolen
and lied and been so bad to my dear, innocent children.
Friendless, I attended your inquiry meeting; but no one came
to me because of the crowd. But on Saturday afternoon, at the
First Presbyterian Church, when they all sang that hymn together,
those beautiful words, &lsquo;Let some drops now fall on me,&rsquo;
and also those, &lsquo;Blessing others, O bless me,&rsquo; it seemed to reach
my very soul. I thought, &lsquo;Jesus can accept me&mdash;&ldquo;even me&rdquo;&rsquo; and
it brought me to his feet, and I feel the burden of sin removed.
Can you wonder that I love those words and I love to hear
them sung?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The original rendering has in a variety of instances been
departed from. To some alterations I have consented, but always
prefer that the words remain unchanged from the form in
which God so richly blessed them. The point of the hymn, in
its close and individual application, is in the &ldquo;Even me&rdquo; at
the end of the verse. I thankfully commit them to whoever desires
to use them in the services of our blessed Master.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_207">207. I would be true</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Howard Arnold Walter</i>, 1884-1918</div>
<p>A popular hymn at young people&rsquo;s summer conferences and other
youth gatherings. The words have often been reprinted in trade journals
and newspapers and used on many a motto card. The ideals of
youth&mdash;truth, purity, strength, bravery, friendship, generosity, humility,
laughter, love, and helpfulness, encompassed in these few lines&mdash;were all
revealed in the author&rsquo;s brief life.</p>
<p>Howard Arnold Walter was graduated <i>cum laude</i> in 1905 from
Princeton University while Woodrow Wilson was president of the
institution. He then entered Hartford Theological Seminary to prepare
himself for the ministry, but after the first year went to Japan to
teach English in Waseda University in Tokyo. After one year,
he returned to Hartford where, upon graduation, he won the Two-Year
Fellowship. In 1909 and 1910 he studied in Edinburgh and in German
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
Universities. He chose the foreign mission field for life service but, owing
to a weak heart, was unable to pass the required physical examination.
In spite of his handicap, he volunteered for Y.M.C.A. work and was assigned
by John R. Mott to India, where he worked among the Mohammedan
students in Foreman Christian College, Lahore. He died there
November 1, 1918, during the influenza epidemic, leaving a devoted
wife and three small children. The words, &ldquo;I would be true,&rdquo; were inscribed
on a memorial tablet erected in his home church in New Britain,
Conn.</p>
<p>The hymn was written in 1907 in Japan when Walter was just 23
years old. Recalling the joys and friendships of his home, the words
came to him on New Year&rsquo;s morning as he was on his knees. He
mailed the poem entitled, &ldquo;My Creed,&rdquo; to his mother who sent it to
<i>Harper&rsquo;s Magazine</i> in order to share with others the beauty of its message.
It appeared in the May, 1907, issue of that magazine and later
found its way into a number of hymn books.</p>
<p>The third stanza, making the hymn more complete, was later written
by the author and sent to Rev. Theodore A. Green, minister of the
First Church of Christ, New Haven, Connecticut:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I would be prayerful through each busy moment;</p>
<p class="t0">I would be constantly in touch with God;</p>
<p class="t0">I would be tuned to hear the slightest whisper;</p>
<p class="t0">I would have faith to keep the path Christ trod.</p>
</div>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">PEEK.</span> No one seemed to know anything of the composer of
this tune until very recently when Dr. Reginald L. McAll, secretary of
the Hymn Society of America, assigned to the Hon. Edgar M. Doughty,
Brooklyn, an official referee of the New York State Supreme Court, an
accomplished musician and active member of the Baptist Church, the
task of searching out in behalf of the Society the facts concerning Mr.
Peek. The Hon. Mr. Doughty completed his research just before his
death in 1947, at the age of 80 and the information presented here is
based on a document compiled from his papers by his secretary. Miss
Mildred Taylor Denisch:</p>
<p>Joseph Yates Peek, 1843-1911, born in Schenectady, N. Y., had very
little formal musical training, but was endowed with a love for music
and considerable native musical ability and became a proficient amateur
performer on the violin and piano. In early life he was a carpenter
and farmer but later established a business as florist and horticulturist.
A deeply religious man, always interested in the church, he retired
from business in 1904, and in spite of his advanced years, became
a prominent lay preacher in the Methodist Church. In 1911 he
was ordained, but his career as a regular minister was cut short when
a heart attack, which occurred while preaching, resulted in his death.
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
Peek was a humble Christian gentleman who sought no honors for himself,
which may account for the fact that his identity as the composer
of this tune remained hidden so long. Then, too, he may have felt that
the credit for the tune did not belong entirely to himself, for he received
considerable help from a friend, Dr. Tuller, an organist and
composer, who jotted down the notes as Peek whistled the melody, and
later added the harmonization.</p>
<p>Peek had received a copy of Walter&rsquo;s poem which was printed on a
New Year&rsquo;s card and entitled, &ldquo;My Creed.&rdquo; He was greatly impressed
with the words, and in a moment of inspiration gave them wings of song
to carry them over the wide world.</p>
<p>The tune has become immensely popular in spite of its weak down-curve
of melody. The hymn may also be sung to Barnby&rsquo;s more sturdy
tune, &ldquo;Perfect Love&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_312">312</a>), which fits the words perfectly.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_208">208. How happy is he born and taught</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Henry Wotton</i>, 1568-1639</div>
<p>The original of this hymn was published in <i>Reliquiae Wottonianae</i>
with a memoir by Isaac Walton, 1651. The poem was altered somewhat
to make it suitable for a congregational hymn.</p>
<p>Henry Wotton graduated from Oxford in 1588. He had a varied
career, travelling on the continent, acting as agent to the Earl of Essex
for collection of foreign intelligence, and then settling in Venice where
he was ambassador at the court from 1604-24, with two intervals during
which he was engaged in diplomatic missions to other countries and in
parliamentary work in England. From 1624 until his death he was
provost of Eton. Besides the above-named book, he published <i>The
Elements of Architecture</i>, 1624, and <i>Ad Regem e Scotia reducem</i> in
1633.</p>

<div class="author"><i>Bernard Barton</i>, 1784-1849</div>
<p>A useful hymn, by a Quaker poet, setting forth the characteristic
Quaker doctrine of the &ldquo;Inner Light,&rdquo; based on I John 1:7: &ldquo;But if we
walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with
another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all
sin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>The hymn appeared in the author&rsquo;s <i>Devotional Verses</i>, London, 1826.</p>
<p>Bernard Barton, known in England as the &ldquo;Quaker Poet&rdquo; (as was
Whittier in America), was born in London and educated at a Quaker
school at Ipswich. When 26 years old he became a Clerk in Alexander&rsquo;s
Bank at Woodbridge, Suffolk, and stayed there the remainder of his
life. On Nov. 16, 1843, he wrote in a letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I took my seat on the identical stool I now occupy at the
desk to the wood of which I have now well-nigh grown, in the
third month of the year 1810, and there I have sat for three
and thirty years beside the odd eight months without one
month&rsquo;s respite in all that time. I often wonder that my health
has stood this sedentary probation as it has and that my mental
facilities have survived three and thirty years of putting down
figures in three rows, casting them up and carrying them forward,
<i>ad infinitum</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He might have given some of these years to literary pursuits had he
not followed the good advice of Charles Lamb who wrote him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Throw yourself on the world, without any rational plan of
support beyond what the chance employ of booksellers would
afford you! Throw yourself rather, my dear sir, from the steep
Tarpeian rock, slap-dash headlong upon iron spikes. If you
have but five consolatory minutes between the desk and the
bed, make much of them, and live a century in them, rather
than turn slave to the booksellers. They are Turks and Tartars
when they have poor authors at their beck. Hitherto you
have been at arm&rsquo;s length from them&mdash;come not within their
grasp. I have known many authors&rsquo; want for bread&mdash;some
repining, others enjoying the blessed security of a counting-house&mdash;all
agreeing they had rather have been tailors, weavers,
what not? rather than the things they were. I have known some
starved, some go mad, one dear friend literally dying in a workhouse.
Oh, you know not&mdash;may you never know&mdash;the miseries
of subsisting by authorship!</p>

<p>He published eight or ten volumes of verse. His writings show an
extensive acquaintance with the Scriptures.</p>

he was in the service of Empress Catherine of Russia, who a few
years later was receiving Mennonites from Danzig and West Prussia to
settle her crown lands at Chortitz. Paisiello was called to Paris to organize

<p>One of the finest hymns of consecration and service. It has been
translated into many languages, including Russian, and many of Africa
and Asia.</p>
<p>The author&rsquo;s own story of how this hymn was written after her visit
in a certain home throws a vivid light on her evangelical zeal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There were ten persons in the house, some unconverted and
long prayed for, some converted but not rejoicing Christians.
He gave me the prayer, &ldquo;Lord give me ALL in this house.&rdquo; And
He just did. Before I left the house everyone had got a blessing.
The night of my visit, after I had retired, the governess
asked me to go to the two daughters. They were crying. Then
and there both of them trusted and rejoiced. I was too happy
to sleep, and passed most of the night in praise and renewal of
my own consecration; and these little couplets formed themselves
and chimed in my heart one after the other, till they
finished with &ldquo;Ever, ONLY, ALL for Thee!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">HENDON.</span> This tune appeared first in America in <i>Carmina
Sacra</i>, 1841, edited by Lowell Mason. The composer, Henri Abraham
C&eacute;sar Malan, 1787-1864, born in Geneva, Switzerland, was a man of
many interests. He was a well educated minister, a blacksmith, carpenter,
printer, and artist. He had a burning zeal for the conversion of
souls. Convinced that the national church stood in need of reform, he
aroused much opposition. After preaching an unorthodox sermon at
the College of Geneva, he was dismissed from his regentship at the
college and was finally driven from the state church. He then built

overflowing crowds and becoming widely known throughout Belgium,
France, England, and Scotland for his evangelism. He wrote more
than 1,000 hymns and set tunes to them, a remarkable achievement.

Church, Malan has a permanent place in French Hymnody.</p>

<div class="author"><i>Adelaide Pollard</i>, 1862-1934</div>
<p>A hymn of the believer&rsquo;s humble resignation to God, as the clay to
the potter.</p>
<p>The author, Adelaide Addison Pollard, was a modest poet. She
signed her writings for many years with only her initials, but in recent
times her publishers have used her full name. Miss Pollard was born in
Iowa, but died in New York City. She was buried in the family plot
at Ft. Madison, Iowa. While a teacher of elocution and expression, she
became interested in deeper spiritual things through the ministry of
R. A. Torrey and James M. Gray, and enrolled for further Bible
training at the Moody Bible Institute, Chicago. She became a teacher
in the Missionary Alliance Bible School at Nyack, N. Y., and also did
missionary work in South Africa. Miss Pollard wrote numerous hymns
and devotional poems. Her two best-known hymns are: &ldquo;Have Thine
own way, Lord,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shepherd of Israel.&rdquo; Her mother was Rebecca
Pollard who wrote the song poem, &ldquo;I surrender all,&rdquo; for which D. B.
Towner wrote the music.</p>

The hymn was rewritten by Edward Osler, 1798-1863, for Hall&rsquo;s <i>Mitre

It was first published in Cottman&rsquo;s <i>Ten Original Tunes</i>, 1874, and has

<p>Based on John 9:4: &ldquo;I must work the works of him that sent me,
while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.&rdquo; The hymn
was written when the author, eighteen years old, lived in Canada. It
was published in a Canadian newspaper and later in her small volume

<p>Anna Louisa Walker was born in England but went in her teens with
her parents to Sania, Canada, where her brothers were railway engineers.
Returning to England, she became a governess for a time, then
she reviewed books, making her home with her second cousin, a Mrs.

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_222">222. Where cross the crowded ways of life</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Frank Mason North</i>, 1850-1935</div>
<p>An unexcelled &ldquo;Hymn for the City.&rdquo; The following account of it is
given in <i>The Churchman</i>, July, 1938, in an article by Eloise R. Griffith,
on &ldquo;Our Great Hymns&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Frank Mason North, D.D., a well-known clergyman of the
Methodist Church, is the author of this well-loved hymn. It is
sometimes called &ldquo;A Prayer for the City,&rdquo; or &ldquo;A Prayer for
the Multitudes,&rdquo; and has the distinction of appearing in more
standard hymnals today than any other hymn written in this
century. To those of us who are concerned about &ldquo;how the
other half lives,&rdquo; and who know either from our own experiences
or those of friends about the darker side of life in a
great city and particularly in our own country during the last
nine years,&mdash;this beautiful hymn never fails to find a heartfelt
response. It paints a picture with which many city dwellers
are all too familiar.</p>
<p>In 1903, Dr. North was editor of <i>The Christian City</i>, the
organ of the Methodist City Missionary Society. His office was
in the Fifth Avenue building of the Methodist Book Concern.
One day one of the professors of Wesleyan University (who
was on the committee to prepare and revise the new Methodist
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
hymnal, and who knew North&rsquo;s ability to write hymns), met
him in one of the halls. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you write a missionary
hymn for us, Dr. North?&rdquo; asked the professor. &ldquo;We need more
missionary hymns in our new hymnal.&rdquo; Dr. North modestly
answered that he did not feel he would be able to write a hymn
worthy of the proposed new hymnal, but that he would try.</p>
<p>Soon after this incident occurred, Dr. North was preaching
a sermon from the text in St. Matthew 22:9: &ldquo;Go ye therefore
into the highways,&rdquo; etc. During his preparation for this sermon,
he was again especially impressed by the rendering of the
Greek text in the Revised Version, which reads &ldquo;Go ye therefore
into the partings of the highways.&rdquo; Dr. North thought of
and described in his sermon the appealing challenge made by
great crowds of people thronging the crossroads of the city&mdash;places
like Madison Square and Union Square in the New
York of 1903. Dr. North knew New York City very thoroughly,
and his heart yearned over the sick, the lonely, the destitute,
the troubled. So, while he preached, the first line of this great
hymn came to him&mdash;&ldquo;Where cross the crowded ways of life.&rdquo;
It did not take him long to compose the words which followed,
and after the publication of the hymn in <i>The Christian City</i>,
it was at once accepted for the new Methodist hymnal of 1905.
The hymn is widely used in Canada and throughout Great
Britain, and has been translated into several foreign languages,
including some of the Far East ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">GERMANY</span> is a fine long-meter tune found in a book, <i>Sacred
Melodies</i>, in which the compiler, William Gardiner, 1770-1853, an
English stocking manufacturer interested in music, collected compositions
by the best foreign composers, adapting them to English words.
The tune is also known by the name &ldquo;Walton,&rdquo; especially in England.
As to its origin, Gardiner says in his book, <i>Music and Friends</i>, that it &ldquo;is
somewhere in the works of Beethoven, but where I cannot now point
out.&rdquo; This may be a mistake, for no one else has ever found it in a
Beethoven collection.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_223">223. O Master, let me walk with Thee</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Washington Gladden</i>, 1836-1918</div>
<p>A greatly loved service hymn which the author entitled, &ldquo;Walking
with God.&rdquo; In a note dated June 15, 1907, Gladden says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This hymn was written in 1879 for a magazine, <i>Sunday
Afternoon</i>, which I was then editing. There were three eight-line
stanzas. Dr. Charles H. Richards found the poem, which
was not intended for a hymn, and made a hymn of it by
omitting the second stanza, which was not suitable for devotional
purposes.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>The omitted stanza reads as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Master, let me walk with Thee</p>
<p class="t0">Before the taunting Pharisee;</p>
<p class="t0">Help me to bear the sting of spite,</p>
<p class="t0">The hate of men who hide thy light,</p>
<p class="t0">The sore distrust of souls sincere</p>
<p class="t0">Who cannot read thy judgments clear,</p>
<p class="t0">The dullness of the multitude</p>
<p class="t0">Who dimly guess that thou art good.</p>
</div>
<p>Washington Gladden, distinguished Congregational minister and
author, was reared on a farm near Oswego, N. Y., attending country
school and Oswego Academy and later entering Williams College, from
which he graduated in 1859. He was licensed to preach in 1860; then
held pastorates in Congregational churches in New York and Massachusetts,
and finally in 1882 began his widely known and influential work
as pastor of the First Congregational Church in Columbus, Ohio,
which was to last for 28 years. His lectures and writings on social
questions were prophetic messages of the time. After 50 years in the
ministry, he wrote: &ldquo;If the church would dare to preach and practice
the things which Jesus Christ has commanded, she would soon regain
her lost power.&rdquo; He is the author of thirty or more volumes but is remembered
best by this poem which has come into such wide use in the
worship services of all the churches.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">MARYTON</span> was written for the words, &ldquo;Sun of my soul, Thou
Savior dear,&rdquo; in <i>Church Hymns and Tunes</i>, 1874; but it has become inseparably
associated with Gladden&rsquo;s hymn. Permission to use this
hymn was granted by the author only on condition that it be used
with this tune.</p>
<p>The composer, Henry Percy Smith, 1825-98, was a minister in the
Church of England, deeply interested in church music. After graduating
from Balliol College, Oxford, he served various churches as curate
and vicar and finally became chaplain at Cannes and Canon of
Gibraltar.</p>

<p>A hymn of the Christian warfare, written by a Church of England
clergyman for a children&rsquo;s processional, but now having a much wider
use. The author gave the following account of the writing of the hymn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whitmonday is a great day for school festivals in Yorkshire.
One Whitmonday, thirty years ago, it was arranged that our
school should join forces with a neighboring village. I wanted
the children to sing when marching from one village to another;
so I sat up at night, resolved that I would write something
myself. &ldquo;Onward, Christian soldiers&rdquo; was the result. It
was written in great haste, and I am afraid some of the rhymes
are faulty. Certainly nothing has surprised me more than its
popularity.</p>

<p>A hymn challenging the <i>men</i> of the church to loyal service to Christ.
It is widely used in America and has found a place in English and Canadian
hymnals. Concerning the origin of the hymn, Dr. Merrill says,
in a letter to the writer, dated, April 18, 1947:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was asked back in 1911 to write a hymn to be used in the
&ldquo;Brotherhood Movement,&rdquo; then going strong. I had come
upon an article by Gerald Stanley Lee, entitled, &ldquo;The Church
of the Strong Men&rdquo;; and that gave me a start. I can give no
interesting details as to how I wrote it; I just did it.</p>
<p>Highchurchmen have objected to the hymn, because they
have said that only God can make the church great. To that
I have answered that if anyone can show me a single instance
in history where God has made the church great without using
<span class="small">MEN OF GOD</span> to do it, I should be interested. No answer has
ever come. I heard that hymn sung in Europe, in India, China,
and Japan.</p>

in an Episcopal Church at Charleston, S. C. He edited the <i>Greatorex
Collection</i> of 1856 and did much to improve the standards of music
used in the worship service. He composed a widely used setting
for the &ldquo;Gloria Patri&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_606">606</a>). Dr. Merrill&rsquo;s hymn has been set to various

<p>Regarding the origin of the hymn, Rev. H. N. Bonar, son of the

<blockquote>
<p>It was probably in the year 1836 that my father first wrote a

by the National Sunday School Union in London.</p>
<p>The German version is a free translation made by Ernst Heinrich
Gebhardt, 1832-99, a Methodist minister and evangelist, known in
Germany, the place of his birth, as the father of German revivalistic
and holiness songs. It is superior, in poetic quality and evangelistic
appeal, to the English original.</p>
<p>Gebhardt was born in Ludwigsburg, W&uuml;rttemberg, July 12, 1832.
He prepared to be an apothecary but later decided to go to Chile,
South America, to live with relatives. After spending five years on a
farm in Chile, he returned to Germany to visit his mother. A shipwreck
on the return voyage resulted in a deep spiritual awakening. Arriving
in Ludwigsburg, he accompanied his mother to the Sylvester
service on New Year&rsquo;s night, 1859, in the Methodist Church, where he
dedicated his life to Christian work. Having decided to become an
evangelist, he attended the school for ministers in the Methodist
Church at Bremen where his zeal and musical gifts were quickly recognized.
He was appointed <i>Reiseprediger</i> and in this capacity served in
Ludwigsburg (1860-62), Heilbronn (1862-66), Pforzheim (1866-68),
Bremen (1868-71), Ludwigsburg (1871-74), Zurich (1874-77), Strassburg
i. E. (1877-81), Biel, Kt. Bern (1880-84), Zwickau (1884-88) and finally
in Karlsruhe (1888-99). Gebhardt was married and had a family of
nine children.</p>
<p>His activities included a trip to the United States, 1881-83, during
which he travelled through 30 States. In Brighton, England, he took
part in holiness meetings held there, and later travelled with R. Pearsall
Smith, of Philadelphia, through Germany and Switzerland, serving
as song leader in the evangelistic meetings conducted by Smith.</p>
<p>Gebhardt is the author of many original hymns and made over 50
translations from the English, most of them from the Moody and
Sankey songs. He compiled numerous song books where his works appeared.
&ldquo;Ich weiss einen Strom&rdquo; was published in his <i>Frohe Botschaft</i>,
1875, a popular book of gospel songs drawn mostly from English sources,
both words and music. The third stanza, omitted here, reads:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Der Strom ist gar tief und sein Wasser ist klar,</p>
<p class="t0">Es schmecket so lieblich und fein;</p>
<p class="t0">Es heilet die Kranken und st&auml;rkt wunderbar,</p>
<p class="t0">Ja, machet die Unreinsten rein!</p>
</div>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ICH WEISS EINEN STROM</span>, originally entitled, &ldquo;Beautiful
Stream,&rdquo; and written in 6/8 time, first appeared in <i>Casket of Sunday School Melodies</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
1865, published by the composer, Asa Hull, in Philadelphia.
The tune is wedded inseparably to Torrey&rsquo;s words. It is very
popular among General Conference of Mennonites churches where it is
usually sung in the slow tempo and dignity of a chorale. Neither the
words nor the music, with its refrain, have the characteristics of a
chorale. It is a useful song, especially for evangelistic services.</p>
<p>Asa Hull was born January 18, 1828, in Keene, N. Y. He studied
harmony and composition with B. F. Baker and Geo. J. Webb in Boston,
and at the age of 20 became organist and choirmaster at Watertown,
Mass. He composed many church tunes. Hull, a pioneer publisher of
Sunday school and gospel song books, was also known as a shrewd
business man. His publications numbered 30 books and about 100
pamphlets. <i>Gem of Gems</i>, published in 1881, sold over 300,000 copies.

<div class="author"><i>Charlotte Elliott</i>, 1789-1871</div>
<p>A hymn which is best understood by those who have had experience
in suffering and sorrow. Entitled, &ldquo;Clinging to Christ,&rdquo; it was written
in 1834, shortly after the death of the author&rsquo;s father and published in
the 1834 edition of her <i>Invalid&rsquo;s Hymn Book</i>.</p>
<p>Charlotte Elliott, a member of the Church of England, was born and
reared amid refined, cultured, Christian surroundings. Her grandfather,
Rev. Henry Venn, was an &ldquo;eminent Church of England divine
of apostolic character and labors,&rdquo; and the author of <i>The Whole Duty
of Man</i>. Charlotte was a woman of keen intellect and was gifted in music
and art. Unfortunately, she became an invalid at 32 and remained so
till the end of her long life, oftentimes enduring great suffering. This
may account for the note of tenderness found in all her hymns. In spite
of her invalidism, she did a large amount of literary work, publishing
four or five volumes of poetry. She was a modest woman, publishing
all her books anonymously. A large number of her 150 hymns are still
in use, the most popular being &ldquo;Just as I am, without one plea&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_458">458</a>).</p>

cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye,
except ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches; He that

He was educated at St. Edmund&rsquo;s College, near Ware. After ordination,
he spent most of his time conducting missions and retreats,
though he was stationed for brief periods in several parishes. He is the
author of numerous hymns which were collected and published by the

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_239">239. There is a place of quiet rest</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Cleland B. McAfee</i>, 1866-1944</div>
<p>The heart of the message of this popular devotional hymn, according
to a statement made by the author to the present writer, is in the
second stanza, &ldquo;There is a place of comfort sweet, near to the heart of
God.&rdquo; Cleland B. McAfee was a distinguished preacher, author, and
teacher in the Presbyterian Church. He was accustomed to write an
original hymn for the communion service in his church. It was in
1901, during his pastorate in Chicago, that a great sorrow came into
his life occasioned by the death of his nephew. The communion was
to be held the following Sunday and the members of the congregation
came to the church tense with speculation about the service and the
kind of hymn their pastor had composed for the day. These simple
words and tune were offered them and seemed to fit the occasion perfectly.
Since then the hymn has been translated into many languages and
gone all over the world. It was not included in the new <i>Presbyterian
Hymnal</i>, 1933, because the words and music were considered to be
more of the nature of a gospel song than a hymn.</p>
<p>Cleland M. McAfee received his education at Park College and
Union Theological Seminary, New York. From 1888 to 1901, he was
pastor and professor at Park College; pastor of the First Presbyterian
Church, Chicago, 1901-04; and of the Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian
Church, Brooklyn, 1904-12. He later was connected with McCormick
Theological Seminary in Chicago, first as Professor of Systematic Theology
and then as president of the institution. He is the author of several
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
books on religious subjects, and also wrote extensively on foreign
missions, a subject in which he had a keen interest.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_240">240. Come unto Me, ye weary</h3>
<div class="author"><i>William C. Dix</i>, 1837-98</div>
<p>Based on some of the precious promises of Christ, especially Matt.
11:28: &ldquo;Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden and I
will give you rest.&rdquo; It may be compared with Bonar&rsquo;s hymn, &ldquo;I heard
the voice of Jesus say&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_142">142</a>) on the same text.</p>
<p>The author gives the story of the hymn as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was ill and depressed at the time, and it was almost to idle
away the hours that I wrote the hymn. I had been ill for many
weeks, and felt weary and faint, and the hymn really expresses
the languidness of body from which I was suffering at the time.
Soon after its composition I recovered, and I always look back
to that hymn as the turning point in my illness.</p>

<p>Based on Psalm 77:19: &ldquo;Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the
great waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James Martineau, English Unitarian, was a man of letters, a philosopher,
a theologian, and the most eloquent and distinguished preacher
of his church in his time. He served churches in Liverpool and London
and was Professor of Mental and Moral Philosophy in Manchester
New College. He edited <i>Hymns for the Christian Church and Home</i>,
1840, a book widely used among Unitarians in England.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">GR&Auml;FENBERG</span>, sung somewhat slowly, is a tune of fine stateliness

Melica</i>, Berlin, 1653. It is also known as &ldquo;<i>Nun Danket All</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johann Cr&uuml;ger, 1598-1662, one of the most distinguished musicians
of his time, was born near Brandenburg. He received a thorough musical
training under Paulus Homberger in Regensburg and in 1622 he
was appointed cantor of the St. Nicholas Lutheran Church, in Berlin,
and one of the masters of the Greyfriars Gymnasium. He founded the
noted choir of St. Nicholas Church. Cr&uuml;ger was a tune-writer of the
first rank and composed some of the most famous and favorite chorales.
He published various collections of hymns, among them the celebrated
<i>Praxis Pietas Melica</i>, 1644, which passed through more than fifty editions.
He died in Berlin, February 23, 1662.</p>

<div class="author"><i>Thomas Moore</i>, 1779-1852</div>
<div class="author"><i>Thomas Hastings</i>, v. 3</div>
<p>A hymn of consolation by an author whose life was far from exemplary.
It may be the hymn should on this account have been omitted;
but something in his heart enabled the author, through his lyrics, to
touch the heart of humanity, and his songs have been widely used and
admired in spite of the strange chapters and romantic incidents in his
life.</p>
<p>Thomas Moore, Irish poet, was born in Dublin, studied at Trinity
College, and then moved to London and began the study of law.
He held a government position in Bermuda for some time and
during his life published many volumes of prose and poetry. He will
always be remembered by his songs, &ldquo;Believe me if all those endearing
young charms,&rdquo; &ldquo;The last rose of summer,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oft in the stilly
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The third stanza is by Thomas Hastings, coeditor with Lowell
Mason of <i>Spiritual Songs for Social Worship</i>, in which the hymn first
appeared. Moore&rsquo;s third stanza, omitted in all hymn books, reads:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Go ask the infidel what boon he brings us,</p>

<div class="author"><i>Samuel Longfellow</i>, 1819-92</div>
<p>A hymn, much-needed, to express the effect of religious faith and
trust upon mental and bodily health. The idea, so essential to the
Gospel, has been too largely neglected in most Protestant Churches.
The hymn is representative of the fine literary and devotional quality
of the author&rsquo;s poetry. Though an American hymn, it was introduced
into the church&rsquo;s worship in England before it was used in this country.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_245">245. My God and Father, while I stray</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Charlotte Elliott</i>, 1789-1871</div>
<p>A hymn written by one who had disciplined herself to accept with
patience and resignation the bitter cross of ill health which was laid
upon her.</p>
<p>She writes of her experience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, many struggles and apparently fruitless ones it has cost
me to become resigned to the appointments of my Heavenly
Father. But the struggle is now over. He knows, and he alone,
what it is, day after day, hour after hour, to fight against bodily
feelings of almost overpowering weakness, languor, and exhaustion;
to resolve not to yield to slothfulness, depression, and
instability, such as the body causes me to long to indulge, but
to rise every morning determined to take for my motto: &ldquo;If any
man will come after Me, let him deny himself, take up his cross
daily and follow Me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hymn is based on Matt. 26:42: &ldquo;O my Father, if this cup may
not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.&rdquo; It is a
hymn of humble resignation. Another hymn, setting forth the will of
God as demanding active co-operation, is found at <a href="#hymn_342">No. 342</a>. Some fine

<div class="author"><i>Tr. by John Wesley</i>, 1703-91</div>
<p>A hymn of comfort to the afflicted and courage to the dying. It is a

are stanzas 9, 10, 12, 13, unaltered, of Wesley&rsquo;s translation, which contains
16 four-line stanzas. Gerhardt passed through the agonies of the
Thirty Years&rsquo; War, and suffered, in addition, the loss of his wife and
four children. He gives expression in this hymn to his own deep feelings
of trust and assurance. His words have helped many anxious souls

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">STATE STREET</span> is a popular tune, scarcely any hymn book
missing it, but it is not wedded to any single hymn. The composer, J.
C. Woodman, 1813-94, born at Newbury, Mass., became one of Lowell
Mason&rsquo;s assistants in introducing music into the public schools of
Boston. He was one of the first soloists of the Boston Academy of Music
and served for a time as organist of the First Presbyterian Church
of Brooklyn. In 1858, Woodman compiled <i>The Musical Casket</i>, which

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_247">247. Day by day the manna fell</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Josiah Conder</i>, 1789-1855</div>
<p>A hymn of confidence that God will supply daily strength for daily
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
needs, based on Exodus 16:12-21 and the petition in the Lord&rsquo;s
Prayer, &ldquo;Give us this day our daily bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hymn suggests a Jewish story quoted by W. F. Tillett in <i>The
Hymns and Hymn Writers of the Church</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pupils of Rabbi Ben Jochai once asked him with regard
to the manna sent to the Israelite host in the wilderness:
&ldquo;Why did not the Lord furnish enough manna to Israel for a
year all at one time?&rdquo; &ldquo;I will answer you with a parable,&rdquo; responded
the teacher. &ldquo;Once there was a king who had a son to
whom he gave a yearly allowance, paying him the entire sum
on a fixed day. It soon happened that the day on which the allowance
was due was the only day in the year when the father
ever saw the son. So the king changed his plan and gave his
son day by day that which sufficed for the day. And now the
son visited his father every morning. Thus God dealt with
Israel.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author, Josiah Conder, born in London, was an editor and publisher.
His friends included a large number of eminent literary and
church men of the early 19th century. He was a member of the Congregationalist
Church. A devout and earnest believer who knew what
it was to struggle for daily bread, he had the occasion to practice the
gospel of daily trust. He wrote many hymns, published more than a
dozen scholarly books, and edited <i>The Congregational Hymn Book</i> in
1836, a work which attained wide popularity in England.</p>

The present arrangement was made by Joseph Holbrook, in

<p>Joseph Holbrook, 1822-88, born near Boston, was a tune writer of

gain. For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can
carry nothing out. And having food and raiment let us be therewith
content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne Steele was the first woman writer of English hymns. Her
father was a timber merchant who for 30 years was deacon and occasional
preacher in the Baptist Church in Hampshire, England, and
then for 30 years more he was pastor, without salary, of the same
church. On the day before Miss Steele was to be married, at the age of
21, her fiance met accidental death through drowning. Out of this bitter
experience in her early life and a succession of other trials, came this
lyric of resignation and hope. The original has 10 stanzas, the last
three of which have been edited by Augustus Toplady to make this
her best hymn. Miss Steele is the foremost of Baptist hymn writers.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">NAOMI</span>, a tune brought to America by Lowell Mason, was

<p>A hymn of love, trust, and hope, based on Phil. 1:21: &ldquo;For me to
live is Christ, and to die is gain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard Baxter, English Presbyterian, was born in Shropshire, England.
He took holy orders in the Church of England, but withdrew
from this church to become one of the outstanding Nonconformists of
his time. Though he never attended university, he published over 250
volumes, among them several classics, <i>The Reformed Pastor</i> and <i>The
Saints&rsquo; Everlasting Rest</i>. A fearless man and willing to suffer for what
he believed to be right, Baxter did not hesitate to rebuke Cromwell for
his assumption of supreme power of the State. Once, when falsely
charged of libeling the Church, Chief Justice George Jeffreys taunted
him by, &ldquo;Richard, I see the rogue in thy face.&rdquo; Baxter replied, &ldquo;I had
not known before that my face was a mirror.&rdquo; After an infamous trial,
Baxter was condemned and thrown into prison where he remained for
18 months.</p>
<p>As to music in the church, he did not share the views of the large
number of his fellow Puritan clergymen who disapproved of it. &ldquo;I
have made a psalm of praise in the holy assembly the chief delightful exercise
of my religion and my life, and have helped to bear down all the
objection which I have heard against church music.&rdquo; He also took a
stand for the use of original hymns to supplement psalm singing, and
favored the use of the organ, though he did not introduce the latter
where it led to disputes.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_256">256. Peace, perfect peace</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Edward H. Bickersteth</i>, 1825-1906</div>
<p>This hymn on perfect peace is based on Isaiah 26:3: &ldquo;Thou wilt
keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on Thee: because he
trusteth in Thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The origin of the hymn was furnished Dr. Julian by Rev. S. Bickersteth,
a son of the author:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This hymn was written by Bishop Edward Henry Bickersteth
while he was spending his summer holiday in Harrogate
in the year 1875. On a Sunday morning in August the Vicar of
Harrogate, Canon Gibbon, happened to preach from the text,
&ldquo;Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed
on thee,&rdquo; and alluded to the fact that in the Hebrew the words
are &ldquo;peace, peace,&rdquo; twice repeated and happily rendered in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
1611 translations by the phrase &ldquo;perfect peace.&rdquo; This sermon
set my father&rsquo;s mind working on the subject. He always found
it easiest to express in verse whatever subject was uppermost in
his mind, so that when on the afternoon of that Sunday he
visited an aged and dying relative, Archdeacon Hill, of Liverpool,
and found him somewhat troubled in mind, it was natural
to him to express in verse the spiritual comfort which he desired
to convey. Taking up a sheet of paper, he then and there
wrote down the hymn just exactly as it now stands and read
it to this dying Christian.</p>
<p>It is not always noticed that the first line in each verse is
in the form of a question referring to some one or other of the
disturbing experiences of life, and the second line in each verse
endeavors to give the answer.... The hymn has been translated
into many tongues, and for years I doubt if my father
went many days without receiving from different people assurances
of the comfort which the words had been allowed to
bring to them. The most touching occasion on which, personally,
I ever heard it sung was round the grave of my eldest
brother, Bishop Edward Bickersteth, of South Tokyo, at Chiselden
in 1897, when my father himself was chief mourner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">PAX TECUM</span> was written for this hymn by George Thomas
Caldbeck, 1852-?, concerning whose life one reads contradictory statements.
Some writers say he was a missionary in China when he wrote
this tune; others, including James Moffatt, give the account essentially
as follows: that Caldbeck, while a student in London, was compelled
through ill health to give up his purpose of becoming a missionary,
went to Ireland to teach school and engage in independent missionary
work. Later he returned to London where he did much open-air preaching,
making a meagre living by selling Scripture text-cards from door
to door. For selling without a license, he was arrested one day but
dismissed by the judge on being informed that the defendant was the
composer of this well-known hymn tune.</p>
<p>The tune was arranged by Charles John Vincent, born 1852, English
organist, composer and editor of much church music.</p>

rendering of the Psalm with that of the <i>Scotch Psalter</i>, 1650, (<a href="#hymn_588">588</a>),
where the thought of the psalm and the stately King James version
combine to make up the greatest metrical form of the psalm. Martin

she became a confirmed invalid, but her sufferings served to deepen
her spiritual life. She was a woman of fine intellectual power and

<div class="author"><i>Tr. John M. Neale</i>, 1818-66</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the city was pure gold&rdquo; Rev. 21:21.</p>
<p>This hymn is from a Latin manuscript of 3,000 lines entitled &ldquo;<i>De
Contemptu Mundi</i>&rdquo; (On Contempt of the World), written by Bernard
of Cluny while he was a monk at the famous monastery of Cluny,
France, <i>c.</i> 1145. Practically nothing is known of him except his authorship

of this poem. Two other hymns, &ldquo;Brief life is here our portion,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;For thee, O dear, dear country,&rdquo; not in the <i>Hymnary</i>, are taken
from the same poem. The original was not written as a hymn at all
but as a &ldquo;bitter satire on the fearful corruption of the age,&rdquo; especially of
the Church of Rome, in contrast to which the author paints the joys of
the new Jerusalem. The author employed throughout the unusually
difficult meter known as &ldquo;dactylic hexameter with tailed rhymes,&rdquo; of
which Bernard himself says: &ldquo;Unless the Spirit of wisdom and understanding
had flowed in upon me, I could not have put together so
long a work in so difficult a meter.&rdquo; The reading of the Latin stanzas
best reveal the rhythm and music of the original:</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">EWING</span>, composed for &ldquo;For thee, O dear, dear country&rdquo; (see
above), was originally in triple time and named, &ldquo;St. Bedes.&rdquo; In
<i>Hymns Ancient and Modern</i>, 1861, it was set to the present words and
the tune changed to common time without the consent of the composer.
Ewing disliked the change and expressed himself thus: &ldquo;In my
opinion the alteration of the rhythm has very much vulgarized my little
tune. It now seems to be a good deal like a polka. I hate to hear it.&rdquo;
In spite of the composer&rsquo;s opinion, the tune is generally accepted in its
revised form and considered preferable to the original.</p>
<p>Alexander Ewing, 1830-95, of Aberdeen, Scotland, was a skilled musician.
One evening after choir practice, he modestly introduced what
he called his first effort at writing a hymn tune, offering copies of the
voice parts, and asking the choir to sing it over. This was done, the
choir liked it, and the tune EWING was launched on its long and popular
career.</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">URBS BEATA</span> (The City Beautiful) was composed in 1887 for
these words. The composer found words for the refrain by repeating
lines 1, 6, 7, and 8 of the first stanza. It makes a first-rate choir number.
To keep up the proper tempo it should be sung with two beats to the
measure. When the tune is used for congregational singing, the high
notes in the refrain are intended to be sung by the sopranos in the
choir.</p>
<p>The composer, George LeJeune, 1842-1904, was the son of a well-known
musical family in London. He began his musical career in
Canada; later he studied with Joseph Barnby. His great work was done
as church organist and organ recitalist at St. John&rsquo;s Chapel of Trinity
Parish, New York City, where he served 28 years.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_264">264. One sweetly solemn thought</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Phoebe Cary</i>, 1824-71</div>
<p>A poem in contemplation of heaven, written in 1852, entitled, &ldquo;Nearer
Home,&rdquo; with no thought of its being used as a hymn. In fact its
original irregular rhythm hardly permitted it to be sung. The words
have been changed to fit the short-meter tune, and have become popular
as a hymn. Upon reading the story of how the hymn was instrumental
in the conversion of two gamblers in China, who, after betting and
drinking and card playing, decided upon a change of life and consecrated
themselves to Christian work, Miss Cary wrote to a friend:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I enclose the hymn and story for you, not because I am vain
of the notice, but because I thought you would feel a peculiar
interest in them when you knew the hymn was written eighteen
years ago (1852) in your house. I composed it in the little,
back, third-story bedroom on Sunday morning after coming
from church, and it makes me happy to think that any word I
could say has done a little good in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Phoebe Cary was born on a farm near Cincinnati, Ohio. Her
early days were a struggle with hardship and poverty. &ldquo;I have cried
in the street because I was poor,&rdquo; she wrote in her later and more
prosperous years, &ldquo;and the poor always seem nearer to me than the
rich.&rdquo; With her sister Alice Carey, she published a small volume of
verse in 1849, then the two moved to New York City where they became
quiet but influential leaders in literary society. Their friendship
with Whittier was a noted factor in the lives of the Carey sisters.
Phoebe was a member of the Church of the Pilgrims in New York, and
later attended the Church of the Stranger in the same city.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_265">265. Sunset and evening star</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Alfred Tennyson</i>, 1809-92</div>
<p>A song of immortality, written in ten minutes in the author&rsquo;s eighty-first
year. It is always printed at the end of Tennyson&rsquo;s poems. Tennyson
once said: &ldquo;I can hardly understand how any great, imaginative
man, who has lived, suffered, thought and wrought, can doubt of the
soul&rsquo;s continuous progress in the after life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poem was written on an October day in 1889, as the poet was
crossing from Aldworth to Farringford. Tennyson&rsquo;s son wrote in his
<i>Memoir</i> of his father, concerning its origin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before he reached Farringford he had the moaning of the
bar in his mind, and after dinner he showed me this poem
written out. I said: &ldquo;That is the crown of your life&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;
He answered: &ldquo;It came in a moment.&rdquo; He explained the
&ldquo;Pilot&rdquo; as &ldquo;that Divine and Unseen who is always guiding us.&rdquo;
A few days before my father&rsquo;s death, in 1892, he said to me:
&ldquo;Mind you put &lsquo;Crossing the Bar,&rsquo; at the end of all editions of
my poems.&rdquo; My father considered Edmund Lushington&rsquo;s translation
into Greek of &ldquo;Crossing the Bar&rdquo; one of the finest translations
he had ever read.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_272">272. Before Jehovah&rsquo;s awful throne</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Isaac Watts</i>, 1674-1748</div>
<p>A paraphrase of Psalm 100, revised by John Wesley.</p>
<p>The original text by Watts began:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sing to the Lord with joyful voice;</p>
<p class="t">Let every land his name adore;</p>
<p class="t0">The British Isles shall sound the noise</p>
<p class="t">Across the ocean to the shore.</p>
</div>
<p>Wesley, considering this an unpromising initial stanza, omitted it,
and changed the second stanza, lines 1 and 2, from</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Nations attend before his throne</p>
<p class="t">With solemn fear, with sacred joy</p>
</div>
<p>to</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Before Jehovah&rsquo;s awful throne</p>
<p class="t">Ye nations bow with sacred joy.</p>
</div>
<p>Wesley severely condemned the practice of changing another&rsquo;s hymns,
but in this case his own &ldquo;transgression&rdquo; resulted in a greatly improved
hymn.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;awful&rdquo; in the first line is spelled &ldquo;awe-full&rdquo; in some hymnals
in order to convey more nearly its original meaning.</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">PARK STREET</span> was composed by Frederick M. A. Venua, 1788-1872,

<h4 class="b">THE CHURCH</h4>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_273">273. The Church&rsquo;s one foundation</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Samuel J. Stone</i>, 1839-1900</div>
<p>A truly great hymn, honoring the church of Christ and longing for
its prosperity. The author, then a young curate of 27 years in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
Church of England, was so stirred by the attacks made on the church
in his time that he determined to write a series of twelve hymns on the
Apostles&rsquo; Creed. This one is based on the article, &ldquo;I believe in the holy
Catholic Church, the communion of saints.&rdquo; The controversy which
then raged in England concerning the nature of the inspiration of the
Scriptures is reflected in the third stanza, the author leaning strongly
on the conservative side.</p>
<p>Samuel J. Stone was a clergyman of the Church of England, born in
Staffordshire, and educated at Oxford. He served various churches,
finally succeeding his father at St. Paul&rsquo;s, Haggerston, London. For
twenty years he had a fruitful ministry in this East End parish among
the poor and depraved, before moving to another part of the city to
another church. He is the author of many hymns and translations and
published several volumes of poetry.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">AURELIA</span> (signifying &ldquo;golden&rdquo;) one of our most stately
tunes, combining ease of singing with churchly dignity, was written
for the hymn, &ldquo;Jerusalem the golden&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_262">262</a>). It was set to the present
hymn in <i>Hymns Ancient and Modern</i> and did much to carry the hymn
into the churches. It has become one of the great processional hymns of
the church.</p>
<p>Samuel Sebastian Wesley, 1810-76, grandson of Charles Wesley, was
like his father, Samuel Wesley, a great English composer and organist.
He had a consuming love of the outdoors, as well as of music, and
was passionately fond of fishing. He was outspoken in his demands for
reform in the music of the church and was, consequently, frequently at
odds with his superiors. Wesley received inadequate recognition for
the contributions he made to the music of his time.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_274">274. Glorious things of thee are spoken</h3>
<div class="author"><i>John Newton</i>, 1725-1807</div>
<p>Based on Psalm 87:3: &ldquo;Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of
God,&rdquo; and other passages, especially Isaiah 33:20, 21, and Exodus 13:22.</p>
<p>It is one of our best hymns on the Church and, says Julian, &ldquo;It ranks
with the first hymns in the language.&rdquo; In ordinary use the omission of
the third stanza is desirable. Augustine Smith suggests in <i>Lyric Religion</i>
that &ldquo;the last score should always be repeated, the second time
sung broader and fuller, building into a superb climax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Newton is remembered among the hymn writers because of
the radical change that took place in his life at conversion. Born in
London, his only schooling was from his eighth to his tenth year. He
went to sea at eleven, his godly mother following the profligate youth
with her prayers. As a midshipman in the navy he deserted his post,
was captured, and reduced to a common seaman, and later became a
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
servant of a slave dealer in Africa. He was converted at 23 after an
awful night steering a water-logged ship in the face of death. Though
converted, he retained certain blind spots in his social outlook and he
continued as a slave dealer. This hymn was written when he was on
a voyage from Sierra Leone, Africa, with a load of slaves shackled
closely together and being taken to London or America to be sold. &ldquo;I
have never had such sweet communion with Jesus as I had on that
voyage,&rdquo; he wrote. This may seem like hypocrisy, but it must be remembered
that slavery was a common practice and that only a few people
of the time understood clearly its complete denial of the spirit of
Christ. It may be that future generations will see in our times evils
that flourished unchallenged while we prayed and sang according to the
light we had. In 1750, Newton married Mary Catlett, a noble and
pious woman, and a godsend in his life. In 1755, he settled down as
customs officer in Liverpool, becoming at the same time greatly interested
in Wesley and Whitefield and other evangelical leaders. Three
years later he became a minister in the Church of England, and in 1764,
he began a distinguished career as curate at Olney, where he was associated
with his friend, William Cowper, the poet. The two were
joint authors of the <i>Olney Hymns</i>, 1779. After sixteen years in Olney,
he moved to London where for 28 years he did faithful and successful
work as rector of St. Mary Woolnoth. He wrote his own epitaph which
is found on a plain marble tablet near the vestry door of his church in
London:</p>
<p class="center">John Newton, Clerk
<br />Once an Infidel and Libertine,
<br />A servant of slaves in Africa,
<br />Was, by the rich mercy of our Lord and Saviour
<br />Jesus Christ
<br />Preserved, restored, and pardoned,
<br />And appointed to preach the Faith
<br />He had long labored to destroy,
<br />Near 16 years at Olney in Bucks
<br />And ... years in this church
<br />On Feb. 1, 1750, he married
<br />Mary,
<br />Daughter of the late George Catlett
<br />Of Catham, Kent.
<br />He resigned her to the Lord who gave her
<br />On 15th of December, 1790</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">AUSTRIAN HYMN</span> is founded on a Croatian melody. It was
used in Germany as the tune of &ldquo;Deutschland &uuml;ber alles.&rdquo; Joseph
Haydn, 1732-1809, made a setting of it to be sung at the Emperor&rsquo;s
birthday, Feb. 12, 1797, to the words, &ldquo;Gott erhalte Franz der Kaiser.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
The tune was a great favorite of Haydn and he used it as a theme in
one of the movements in his famous &ldquo;<i>Emperor Quartet</i>,&rdquo; <a href="#hymn_76">No. 76</a>.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_275">275. I love Thy Kingdom, Lord</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Timothy Dwight</i>, 1752-1817</div>
<p>Based on Psalm 137:5, 6: &ldquo;If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right
hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue
cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my
chief joy.&rdquo; It is rated high among all the hymns on the church and is
probably the earliest American hymn in use today.</p>
<p>Timothy Dwight, the great president of Yale, was the grandson of
Jonathan Edwards and shared in a large measure the intellectual brilliance
of the Edwards family. A precocious youth, he entered Yale
College at 13 and graduated at 17. An outstanding personality of his
time, he was honored for his sound scholarship, elected a member of the
Massachusetts legislature, and served as minister of the Congregational
Church at Greenfield, Conn. From 1795 until his death in 1817,
he was President of Yale, simultaneously holding the Chair of Theology.
His presence at Yale changed the whole moral and religious attitude of
the campus, there having been only four or five professed Christians at
the college, according to Prof. W. W. Sweet, when he became president.
At the request of the General Association of Congregational Churches in
Connecticut and with the concurrence of the Presbyterian General Assembly,
he revised <i>The Psalms of David</i>, by I. Watts, a work which was
used in the Presbyterian and Congregational Churches of Connecticut
for over 30 years.</p>
<p>Dwight did a prodigious amount of work in spite of a serious physical
handicap. His eyesight, for the greater part of forty years, was so
poor that his reading was done only with the greatest of difficulty and
with frequent and agonizing pain behind the eyeballs.</p>

<div class="author"><i>Latin, 6th or 7th century</i></div>
<div class="author"><i>Tr. John M. Neale</i>, 1818-66</div>
<p>From Part II of an ancient Latin hymn of the 6th or 7th century beginning:
&ldquo;<i>Urbs beata Hierusalem</i>.&rdquo; The author is not known. The
first verse reflects Ephesians 2:20-21: &ldquo;And are built upon the foundation
of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief
cornerstone; in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth
unto an holy temple in the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hymn is often used at the dedication of churches, stanzas 3 and

his own composition. His hymn, named &ldquo;Sapphic Ode. For Spiritual

<p>The English version by Pusey is not a translation of the German but
rather a free paraphrase. Philip Pusey, brother of Edward Pusey, the
famous leader in the Oxford Movement, was educated at Oxford. After
graduating he settled on his estate and devoted himself largely to agriculture.
He wrote extensively on agricultural subjects and was one
of the founders of the Royal Agriculture Society. Later he became a
member of Parliament. He wrote this hymn to portray the state of the
Church of England at the time, which he described as being &ldquo;assailed
from without, enfeebled and detracted from within, but on the eve of
a great awakening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Newton and William Cowper, the English poet, instituted
prayer meetings at Olney where the two labored together in a famous
ministry, Newton as minister of the church, and Cowper as his voluntary
assistant. The prayer meetings were attended in such large numbers
that it became necessary to move the services into a large room.
For the first meeting in this new room, each of the men prepared a

<p>Based on Psalm 26:8: &ldquo;Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house,
and the place where thine honor dwelleth.&rdquo; The hymn was written by
William Bullock, then a young sailor-missionary, for the dedication of
a mission chapel at Trinity Bay, Newfoundland, in 1827. Seventy years
later, when a new church located on the same site was dedicated, this
hymn as revised by H. W. Baker, was once more sung. The sermon
preached by Bullock at the opening of the chapel was read to the
people.</p>
<p>Wm. Bullock was educated at Christ&rsquo;s Hospital and then entered the
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
Royal Navy. While on a survey of the coast of Newfoundland, he decided
to devote himself to missionary work in that colony. He did this
and served 32 years under the Society for Propagating the Gospel. He
became Dean of Nova Scotia at Halifax. In 1854, he published <i>Songs
of the Church</i> which, he said, were &ldquo;written amid the various scenes of
missionary life, and are intended for the private and domestic use of
Christians in new countries deprived of all public worship.&rdquo;</p>

English evangelical preacher who was ordained for a small church of
ten communicant members. He is described as a man of &ldquo;amiable disposition,
polished manners, Christian courtesy, and popular with rich

<p>Ada Cross was born in England, November 21, 1844, the daughter of
Henry Cambridge. She married an Australian, the Rev. George F.
Cross, and spent most of her life in Australia where her husband was
minister of the Anglican Church in Coleraine, Victoria. She was interested

honors from St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge; received ordination, served
as one of the chaplains of King George III, and at the time of death
he had been for 32 years the Precentor and Canon of York. A man of
high literary attainments, and a friend of Thomas Gray, he edited that
poet&rsquo;s works in 1775 and later wrote the memoirs of Gray. The latter
was done in the gossiping style, imitated later by Boswell when he
wrote the <i>Life of Samuel Johnson</i>. Mason wrote four volumes of
poetry and won recognition from Johnson as one of the British poets.</p>

a wider use. Dr. G. Campbell Morgan used this hymn every Sunday

refers to the feeding of the multitude beside the Sea of Galilee and not

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_289">289. O Word of God Incarnate</h3>
<div class="author"><i>W. W. How</i>, 1823-97</div>
<p>A hymn addressed to Christ, the Word of God Incarnate, setting
forth in a succession of beautiful figures&mdash;a lantern, the golden casket,
a banner, a beam, chart and compass&mdash;the value of the written word,
and the duty of the Church to carry the light of God&rsquo;s word, both as
incarnate and written, to the nations. It was written in 1867, headed
by the text Prov. 6:23: &ldquo;For the commandment is a lamp; and the law
is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life.&rdquo; The author
himself was a living witness to the power of the Word. His definition
of a minister shows the high ideal he had of the preacher of the Word,
and, incidentally, is an accurate description of his own life:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A man pure, holy, and spotless in his life; a man of much
prayer; in character meek, lowly, and infinitely compassionate;
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
of tenderest love to all; full of sympathy for every pain and sorrow,
and devoting his days and nights to lightening the burdens
of humanity; utterly patient of insult and enmity; utterly
fearless in speaking the truth and rebuking sin; ever ready to
answer every call, to go wherever bidden in order to do good;
wholly without thought of self; making himself the servant of
all; patient, gentle, and untiring in dealing with the souls he
would save; bearing with ignorance, wilfulness, slowness,
cowardice in those of whom he expects most; sacrificing all,
even life itself, if need be, to save some.</p>

are very suggestive: &ldquo;a garden,&rdquo; &ldquo;a deep, deep mine,&rdquo; &ldquo;a starry host.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edwin Hodder was born in England but migrated at 19 years of age
to New Zealand where he was one of a pioneer group of idealists who
introduced progressive sociological ideas for which that country is
noted. He returned to England where he was engaged in the civil
service from 1861 until his retirement in 1897. Hodder wrote biographies

the Book of Nature in the first half and the Book of Scripture in the

second half of the psalm. Instead of following this order, Watts sets
the one over in couplets against the other, so that the first two lines of

<div class="author"><i>John Keble</i>, 1792-1866</div>
<p>A hymn for the children&rsquo;s consecration service, evolved by John
Keble from three hymns&mdash;&ldquo;Shepherd in thy bosom, folded,&rdquo; &ldquo;Loving
Shepherd of Thy sheep&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_429">429</a>), and &ldquo;Infant sorrow, infant weakness,&rdquo;
written by Jane Eliza Leeson. Keble took the main ideas of these
hymns and rewrote them into a hymn of five stanzas, two of which are
omitted here.</p>
<p>Jane Eliza Leeson was born in London and died there. She had
rare gifts in writing for children, and published several books of hymns&mdash;<i>Infant
Hymnings</i>, and <i>Hymns and Scenes of Childhood</i>&mdash;specially for
children. Very little is known of her life, except that she was a prominent
figure in the Catholic Apostolic Church and that some of her
hymns were supposedly &ldquo;prophetical utterances,&rdquo; prompted by the Holy
Spirit, at public services, which she &ldquo;delivered slowly with short pauses
between the verses.&rdquo; Late in life she united with the Roman Catholic
Church.</p>

<div class="author"><i>Isaac Watts</i>, 1674-1748</div>
<p>This hymn is based on II Timothy 1:8-12.</p>
<p>James Moffatt writes that when Henry Drummond was on his death
bed, Nov. 7, 1897, his friend, Dr. Hugh Barbour, played several hymn
tunes to him without gaining any response. Then he tried the Old
Scots melody of &ldquo;Martyrdom&rdquo; to which Drummond beat time with his
hand and joined in the words, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not ashamed to own my Lord.&rdquo;
When the hymn was done, he said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to beat that,
Hugh.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="author"><i>Horatius Bonar</i>, 1808-89</div>
<p>Entitled by the author, &ldquo;This Do in Remembrance of Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a famous communion hymn, emphasizing, in keeping with the
Reformed tradition, the thought that Christ Himself presides at His
Table. All His followers are therefore welcome.</p>
<p>Three members of the Bonar family became eminent ministers in
the Free Church of Scotland (Presbyterian)&mdash;Andrew in Glasgow; John
in Greenock; and Horatius in Edinburgh. Horatius was accustomed to
visit his brother John once a year at the communion service. Hymns
were still not permitted to be sung in the church, but an original poem
was invariably read after the communion. This hymn was written by
Horatius Bonar at the request of his brother John for the occasion of
such a visit in October, 1855. It has become a widely used communion
hymn in all churches.</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">LANGRAN</span>, known in England as &ldquo;St. Agnes,&rdquo; is named after

separately in 1861 and two years later appeared in <i>Psalms and Hymns
adapted to the services of the Church of England, with accompanying

note at the bottom of the page where this hymn appears:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As this hymn consists of one verse only, it is suggested that it

<blockquote>
<p>And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went:
and he made as though he would have gone further. But they
constrained him saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening,

<div class="author"><i>Dorothy Blomfield Gurney</i>, 1858-1932</div>
<div class="author"><i>Doxology added by John Ellerton</i>, 1826-93</div>
<p>A singularly appropriate hymn for a Christian wedding. The author,
Dorothy Gurney, born near London in 1858, was the daughter of Rev.
Frederick Blomfield, a minister of the Anglican Church. She married
a minister&rsquo;s son, Gerald Gurney, and with her husband, united with the
Roman Catholic Church in 1919. Mrs. Gurney has given the following
account of the writing of this popular hymn for holy matrimony:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We were all singing hymns one Sunday evening and had just
finished &ldquo;O Strength and Stay,&rdquo; the tune to which was an especial
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
favorite of my sister&rsquo;s, when someone remarked what a
pity it was that the words should be unsuitable for a wedding.
My sister, turning suddenly to me, said: &ldquo;What is the use of a
sister who composes poetry if she cannot write me new words to
this tune?&rdquo; I picked up a hymn-book and said: &ldquo;Well, if no
one will disturb me, I will go into the library and see what I
can do.&rdquo; After about fifteen minutes I came back with the
hymn, &ldquo;O perfect Love,&rdquo; and there and then we all sang it to
the tune of &ldquo;Strength and Stay.&rdquo; It went perfectly, and my sister
was delighted, saying that it must be sung at her wedding.
For two or three years it was sung privately at many London
weddings, and then it found its way into the hymnals. The
writing of it was no effort whatever after the initial idea had
come to me of the twofold aspect of perfect union, love and
life; and I have always felt that God helped me to write it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the most popular wedding hymn extant.</p>

<div class="author"><i>Fanny J. Crosby</i>, 1820-1915</div>
<p>Written April 30, 1868, at the request of W. H. Doane, composer of
the tune to which it was to be sung. The hymn and tune were published
first in <i>Songs of Devotion for Christian Associations</i>, 1870. It
is a tender lyric which has given peace and satisfaction to many who
have faced death and especially to mothers who have lost children.</p>
<p>Fanny Crosby, born in Putnam County, N. Y., became blind when
six weeks old as the result of an application of a warm poultice to her
eyes. She was educated in the New York (City) Institute for the Blind
and there served as a teacher for a time. In 1858, she was married to
Alexander van Alstyne, a blind musician. Miss Crosby began writing
verses when a child of eight years and throughout her long life showed
a marvelous facility for expression in poetry, which resulted in the
writing of nearly 6,000 hymns besides many secular poems. Many of
her hymns were written for W. H. Doane, Robert Lowry, Philip Phillips,
Ira Sankey, and others who were editors of evangelistic song books.
She is best known by her maiden name but also wrote under her married
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>

Episcopal Church. Ten of her hymns are in the <i>Hymnary</i>.</p>

in his church. A music enthusiast, he published 35 collections of song
books and composed numerous hymn tunes, anthems, and cantatas. In
1875, Denison University, Granville, Ohio, conferred on him the degree
of Doctor of Music.</p>

<p>The third and fourth verses, containing the idea of One Church, are
among the finest in the whole range of hymnody.</p>
<p>The hymn was a great favorite of John Wesley. It so happened that
he gave it out to be sung at a service he was conducting, at the very
hour of the death of his brother Charles, giving the hymn a peculiarly
pathetic interest.</p>

<h4 class="b">CHURCH UNITY</h4>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_320">320. In Christ there is no East or West</h3>
<div class="author"><i>John Oxenham</i>, 1852-1941</div>
<p>A poem of human brotherhood, carrying a fine missionary message
much needed in our day. It is written in the spirit of St. Paul&mdash;&ldquo;where
there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision,
Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all and in
all,&rdquo; Col. 3:11. It stands in striking contrast to Kipling&rsquo;s more narrow
nationalism in his &ldquo;East is East, and West is West, and never the twain
shall meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This hymn which has now found its way into most modern hymn
books was written for a missionary pageant, <i>The Pageant of Darkness
and Light</i>, which the London Missionary Society asked the author to
write, for use in connection with a great missionary exhibition in London,
an affair which ran for a month and did much to stimulate interest
in missions in all the churches. Oxenham wrote the <i>libretto</i> and
planned the scenes for the pageant. The composer of the music, Hamish
MacCunn, sent to him in a hurry one day for a few verses to fill in
a gap. To this request Oxenham responded with the beautiful, simple
lines, &ldquo;No East or West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Oxenham, English publisher, poet, and novelist, was born in
Manchester. He wrote this poem in 1908; and in 1939 sent the hymn,
&ldquo;Peace in our time&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_357">357</a>) with a personal letter to the editors of the
<i>Hymnary</i>. The name John Oxenham is a <i>nom de plume</i> for William
Arthur Dunkerley. For some years Dunkerley was engaged in business,
in the interest of which he travelled extensively in Europe and Canada,
and lived in France and the United States. He once investigated the possibilities
of cotton growing and sheep raising in the Southern States
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
but decided against the venture. He began writing as a relief from
business, and then, later, dropped business in favor of writing.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ST. PETER</span>, also known as &ldquo;St. Peter&rsquo;s, Oxford,&rdquo; was composed
for Psalm 118, by Alexander R. Reinagle, 1799-1877, distinguished organist
for thirty-one years in St. Peter&rsquo;s-in-the-East Church, Oxford. The
tune derives its name from the church which the composer served so
long. It appeared in <i>Psalm Tunes for the Voice and the Pianoforte</i>,
published by Reinagle in 1830. It is a majestic tune and should be
sung in moderate time with strong rhythmic accent.</p>

<p>Joseph Swain, English Baptist minister and hymn writer, lost his
parents early in life and was apprenticed to an engraver. He led a
careless, frivolous life until his conversion at the age of twenty-two,
when he became a fervent Christian. He qualified for the Baptist
ministry and began serving as minister of a congregation in East Street,
Walworth, in 1791. His poetic gifts, formerly given worldly and superficial
expression, were now turned with great effect to his evangelistic
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_324">324. The morning light is breaking</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Samuel F. Smith</i>, 1808-95</div>
<p>A great missionary hymn, though a little too optimistic. It was written
in 1832 while the author was a student in Andover Theological
Seminary. After reading an inspiring account by Adoniram Judson of
his great missionary work in Burma, Smith put his enthusiasm for missions
into these verses, now sung in all the churches.</p>
<p>Rev. Samuel F. Smith, Harvard graduate in the class with Oliver
Wendell Holmes, became the foremost American Baptist hymn writer
of the 19th century. He is the author of numerous hymns but is best
known by &ldquo;My country, &rsquo;tis of thee&rdquo; and the present hymn. His desire
to be a missionary himself was never fulfilled, but his son volunteered
for the service and became the successor to Judson in the great work
in Burma. &ldquo;The morning light is breaking&rdquo; has been translated into
many tongues. In a letter dated March 17, 1883, the author said of
this hymn: &ldquo;I have heard versions of it sung in Karen, Burman, Italian,
Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, German, and Telegu.&rdquo; Dr. Smith was a
great linguist. He taught modern languages for a time in Colby College
and had a familiarity with no less than fifteen languages. It is
said that at the age of 86 he was seeking a suitable textbook to use in
the study of the Russian language. He served as minister of Baptist
churches at Waterville, Me., and Newton Center, Mass., and was secretary
of the Baptist Missionary Union for 15 years.</p>

work.</p>
<p>The hymn first appeared in <i>A Missionary Hymn Book</i>, 1922, published
by the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge, in
London. The author, Rev. Hardwicke Drummond Rawnsley, was an
influential minister and educator in the Church of England. He spent
much of his life in the Lake District in northern England, and, being a
man of public spirit and a lover of nature, he championed the rights of
the people in securing for public use in perpetuity many beautiful
tracts of the Lake District and other parts of the country. His friends
remembered him as one &ldquo;who, greatly loving the fair things of nature
and of art, set all his love to the service of God and man.&rdquo;</p>

The hymn was suggested to him by a motto, &ldquo;Christ for the World and
the World for Christ,&rdquo; made from branches of evergreen, in a Cleveland
church where a Y.M.C.A. convention was held. One night, walking
home from the convention to which he was a delegate, the words of the

the opening hymn for each term of school.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_328">328. O Zion, haste, thy mission high fulfilling</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Mary A. Thomson</i>, 1834-1923</div>
<p>One of the strongest and most useful missionary hymns in the English
language.</p>
<p>Mary Ann Faulkner was born in London but came to this country
as a girl and became the wife of John Thomson, Librarian of the Free
Library, in Philadelphia. A member of the Protestant Episcopal Church,
her hymns, about forty in all, were published in <i>The Churchman</i>,
New York, and in <i>The Living Age</i>, Chicago.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>Of the origin of this missionary hymn, Mrs. Thomson has written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote the greater part of the hymn, &ldquo;O Zion, haste,&rdquo; in the
year 1868. I had written many hymns before, and one night,
while I was sitting up with one of my children who was ill of
typhoid fever, I thought I should like to write a missionary
hymn to the tune of the hymn beginning, &ldquo;Hark, hark, my
soul, angelic songs are swelling,&rdquo; as I was fond of that tune;
but as I could not then get a refrain I liked, I left the hymn
unfinished, and about three years later I finished it by writing
the refrain which now forms part of it. By some mistake 1891 is
given instead of 1871 as the date of the hymn in the (Episcopal)
<i>Hymnal</i>. I do not think it is ever sung to the tune for
which I wrote it. Rev. John Anketell told me, and I am sure
he is right, that it is better for a hymn to have a tune of its
own, and I feel much indebted to the composer of the tune
<span class="small">TIDINGS</span> for writing so inspiring a tune to my words.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She was mistaken in the last sentence, for Walch&rsquo;s tune, strangely
enough, was composed for the words &ldquo;Hark, hark my soul&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_260">260</a>).</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">TIDINGS</span> was written, as stated above, for the hymn, &ldquo;Hark,
hark my soul! Angelic songs are swelling&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_260">260</a>), by James Walch, 1837-1901,
an English composer and organist. The tune was never accepted
for that hymn, because there already were several good tunes for it in
use. In the providence of God, it found this hymn. The union was
favored from the beginning and continues so today.</p>

<p>Jonathan F. Bahnmaier was born at Oberstenfeld where his father,

T&uuml;bingen and became assistant, in 1798, to his father. Later he had an
appointment as Professor of Education and Homiletics at T&uuml;bingen
but resigned in 1819 to become dean and town preacher at Kirchheim-unter-Teck,
a post he held until his death. Bahnmaier was greatly interested
in education, missions, and Bible societies and was on the
committee which compiled the <i>W&uuml;rttemberg Gesangbuch</i>, published
after his death in 1842. One other of his hymns, &ldquo;<i>Jesu als du wiederkehrtest</i>,&rdquo;

<div class="author"><i>George W. Doane</i>, 1799-1859</div>
<p>A stirring missionary hymn entitled, &ldquo;Missions, Home and Foreign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is based on Psalm 60:4: &ldquo;Thou hast given a banner to them that
fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hymn was written in response to a request from the young
women at St. Mary&rsquo;s Hall, Burlington, N. J., a girls&rsquo; college founded by
Bishop Doane, to be sung at a flag raising. The author, writing what
has become a widely known hymn, gave the occasion a far wider significance
than the girls had foreseen.</p>
<p>Bishop George Doane, a zealous advocate of missions, was known
in his own church as &ldquo;the missionary bishop of America.&rdquo; The modern
missionary movement arose and spread in his lifetime. The hymn reflects
Doane&rsquo;s enthusiasm and aggressive missionary leadership.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_333">333. From Greenland&rsquo;s icy mountains</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Reginald Heber</i>, 1783-1826</div>
<p>One of the most famous missionary hymns ever written. An interesting
story is attached to its origin, a detailed account of which was
written by Thomas Edgeworth on the fly-leaf of a facsimile of the
original manuscript as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Whitsunday, 1819, the late Dr. Shipley, Dean of St.
Asaph, and Vicar of Wrexham, preached a sermon in Wrexham
Church in aid of the Society for the Propagation of the
Gospel in Foreign Parts. That day was also fixed upon for the
commencement of the Sunday evening lectures intended to be
established in the church, and the late Bishop of Calcutta
(Heber), then rector of Hodnet, the Dean&rsquo;s son-in-law being
together in the vicarage, the former requested Heber to write
&ldquo;something for them to sing in the morning&rdquo;; and he retired
for that purpose from the table where the Dean and a few
friends were sitting to a distant part of the room. In a short
time the Dean enquired, &ldquo;What have you written?&rdquo; Heber
having then composed the three first verses, read them over.
&ldquo;There, there, that will do very well,&rdquo; said the Dean. &ldquo;No, no,
the sense is not complete,&rdquo; replied Heber. Accordingly he
added the fourth verse, and the Dean being inexorable to his
repeated request of &ldquo;Let me add another; oh, let me add another!&rdquo;
thus completed the hymn of which the annexed is a
facsimile and which has since become so celebrated. It was
sung the next morning in Wrexham Church the first time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tune to which it was sung was &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas when the seas were roaring,&rdquo;
from <i>The Beggar&rsquo;s Opera</i>&mdash;a fine but somewhat incongruous
selection.</p>
<p>The words of the hymn reflect the enthusiasm and zeal of consecrated
youth, eager, like Livingstone, to go out to a distant people needing
help and to sacrifice life for the cause. Greatly interested in missions,
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
Heber was offered the Bishopric of Calcutta and accepted it
against the advice of his friends. After three years of strenuous, devoted
labor, he was stricken with apoplexy and found dead in his bath on the
evening of a busy day in which he had baptized forty-two native converts.</p>
<p>The much-discussed second stanza, omitted in the <i>Hymnary</i> because
of its seeming low estimate of man, is as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">What though the spicy breezes</p>
<p class="t">Blow soft o&rsquo;er Ceylon&rsquo;s isle;</p>
<p class="t0">Though every prospect pleases</p>
<p class="t">And only man is vile;</p>
<p class="t0">In vain with lavish kindness</p>
<p class="t">The gifts of God are strown;</p>
<p class="t0">The heathen in his blindness</p>
<p class="t">Bows down to wood and stone.</p>

<div class="author"><i>Colin Sterne</i>, 1862-1928</div>
<p>A popular missionary hymn, breathing the spirit of Christ&rsquo;s great
commission: &ldquo;Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing
them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the
Holy Spirit: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded
you: and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the

summarized in the chorus.</p>
<p>The words and music are by the same person, Henry Ernest Nichol,
who was born at Hull, England, December 10, 1862. He always signed
his correct name to a tune, and the anagram &ldquo;Colin Sterne,&rdquo; to a
hymn. Oxford University gave him his degree in music. His compositions,
many of them for the church, have the simplicity and directness of
the folk song. The tune here forms a splendid musical setting for the
words and may be sung variously, as a solo, duet, all the voices in unison,
or in four parts.</p>

good news came from the island of Tahiti that the first little band of
mission workers sent there by the London Missionary Society, was
kindly received by the natives, their message heard and welcomed, and
that there was every prospect for the success of the mission. Hearing

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_337">337. Ye Christian heralds, go proclaim</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Bourne H. Draper</i>, 1775-1843</div>
<p>A hymn, originally of four stanzas, written as a farewell to missionaries.</p>
<p>The author, Rev. Bourne H. Draper, was born of a Church of England
family, near Oxford, England. He joined the Baptist Church
while employed as a printer&rsquo;s apprentice at the Clarendon Press, Oxford.
He trained himself for the Baptist ministry and became pastor of
the Baptist Church at Chipping-Norton. A man of great piety and
poetic gift, he wrote numerous books for children as well as devotional
works and volumes of sermons.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">MISSIONARY CHANT</span> appeared in the composer&rsquo;s <i>American
Harp</i>, 1835, where it was identified with this hymn. Concerning the
composition of the tune, Zeuner said: &ldquo;I was sitting on one of those
seats on Boston Commons on a most beautiful moonlight evening, all
alone, with all the world moving about me, and suddenly &lsquo;Missionary
Chant&rsquo; was given me. I ran home as fast as ever I could and put it on
paper before I should forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles Heinrich Christopher Zeuner, 1795-1857, a native of Germany,
came to America at the age of 29 and settled in Boston. His musical
ability was soon recognized, and he was made president of the
Handel and Haydn Society, and later its conductor. He published
a book, <i>American Harp</i>, of nearly 400 pages of tunes, in 1832, mostly his
own compositions. He moved to Philadelphia where he served as organist
of St. Anne&rsquo;s Episcopal Church and later of the Arch Street
Presbyterian Church. Due to harsh criticism of his playing, he became
despondent and took his own life one November day at a lonely spot
in the woods. Zeuner was never married and had no relatives in this
country.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_338">338. How are Thy servants blest</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Joseph Addison</i>, 1672-1719</div>
<p>A hymn of the Christian traveller, particularly descriptive of the experience
of many Christian missionaries. It is known as the &ldquo;Traveller&rsquo;s
Hymn&rdquo; and has been found useful as a part of the daily devotions by
Christians journeying in foreign lands.</p>
<p>It appeared in ten stanzas in the <i>Spectator</i> for September 20, 1712, at
the end of an article on &ldquo;Greatness,&rdquo; with special reference to the
greatness and awesomeness of the sea. The hymn was &ldquo;made by a
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
gentleman upon the conclusion of his travels.&rdquo; Returning in 1700 from
the terrors of a voyage on the Mediterranean Sea, Addison gives here,
years afterwards, a picture of his own trying experiences. The second
stanza describes some of the hardships through which he passed. The
omitted stanzas (3, 4, 5, 7, 8) of the hymn picture the storm at sea, its
subsidence, and the traveller&rsquo;s trust in God. They are as follows:</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_339">339. See how great a flame aspires</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Charles Wesley</i>, 1707-88</div>
<p>A rousing missionary hymn which Wesley wrote after preaching to
the coal miners at Newcastle. The imagery of the great flame was suggested
by the night scene&mdash;the glow in the sky from the blazing fires
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
connected with the mines. The climax of the hymn, stanza 4, was
inspired by an incident in the life of Elijah. When his servant returned
the seventh time from looking toward the sea from the housetop, he
reported: &ldquo;Behold there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea like a man&rsquo;s
hand!... And it came to pass in the meantime that the heaven was

<div class="author"><i>J. Dempster Hammond</i>, 1719-83</div>
<p>The watchword, &ldquo;the whole wide world for Jesus,&rdquo; brings to mind
the motto, &ldquo;The evangelization of the world in this generation,&rdquo; which
served to inspire the Student Volunteer Movement in the days of John
R. Mott, Robert E. Speer, and Sherwood Eddy. Two world wars have
shaken the foundations of the missionary enterprise, but those closest
to the movement still declare the motto to be both a possibility and an
obligation. The missionary forces are making resolute plans for giving
the Gospel to the entire world.</p>
<p>No information is at hand concerning the author, J. Dempster Hammond.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.</span> The composer, John H. Maunder,

his musical education at the Royal Academy of Music in London; held
various musical appointments and became a well-known and popular
accompanist for vocalists. As a composer, he was widely known for his
anthems, cantatas, and services which have met with wide approval.
His <i>A Song of Thanksgiving</i>, a cantata, has been quite popular in this

of languages and dialects than any other English hymn.</p>
<p>Watts did not hesitate to use the name of Jesus in interpreting the

<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>

<p>Based on the petition, &ldquo;Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hymn was written for the <i>Congregational Hymnary</i> (England),
1916. A note by the author explains his purpose in the hymn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hymn was written to declare that in doing God&rsquo;s will,
active co-operation is as much needed as humble resignation.
Charlotte Elliott, in her hymn, &ldquo;My God and Father, while I

was to supplement her hymn as best I could.</p>

<p>Howell Elvet Lewis, of Welsh birth, became an influential leader in
English Congregationalism. He served as minister of the Welsh Tabernacle,

<h4 class="b">NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LIFE&mdash;THE NATION</h4>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_343">343. O beautiful for spacious skies</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Katharine Lee Bates</i>, 1859-1929</div>
<p>A beautiful poem expressing genuine love for America and faith in
human brotherhood. The historical accuracy of the second and third
stanzas may be questioned. To one familiar with New England theocracy,
it is clear that the Pilgrims were not, as the poet suggests, the
champions of freedom of thought and religion. On the contrary, they
were intolerant of any form of opposition, whether religious or political.</p>
<p>The hymn is less limited to the New England landscape than &ldquo;My
country, &rsquo;tis of thee,&rdquo; and probably for that reason has overshadowed
the latter as a popular national hymn.</p>
<p>Katharine Lee Bates, born in Falmouth, Mass., was educated at
Wellesley College where she later became Professor of English. She is
the author of many books.</p>
<p>A folder published by the author, giving the exact title and words
of the hymn, also contains interesting data concerning its origin and
history:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>America the Beautiful</i> was written in its original form, more
literary and ornate than the present version, in the summer of
1893. I was making my first trip west. After visiting at Chicago
the World&rsquo;s Fair, where I was naturally impressed by the symbolic
beauty of the White City, I went on to Colorado Springs.
Here I spent three weeks or so under the purple range of the
Rockies, which looked down with surprise on a summer school.
This had called to its faculty several instructors from the east,
Dr. Rolfe coming from Cambridge to teach Shakespeare, Professor
Todd from Amherst for lectures on Astronomy, Professor
Katharine Coman from Wellesley for a course in Economics.
My own subject, which seemed incongruous enough under that
new and glowing sky, was English Religious Drama.</p>
<p>We strangers celebrated the close of the session by a merry
expedition to the top of Pike&rsquo;s Peak, making the ascent by the
only method then available for people not vigorous enough to
achieve the climb on foot nor adventurous enough for burro-riding.
Prairie wagons, their tail-boards emblazoned with the
traditional slogan, &ldquo;Pike&rsquo;s Peak or Bust,&rdquo; were pulled by horses
up to the half-way house, where the horses were relieved by
mules. We were hoping for half an hour on the summit, but
two of our party became so faint in the rarified air that we were
bundled into the wagons again and started on our downward
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
plunge so speedily that our sojourn on the peak remains in
memory hardly more than one ecstatic gaze. It was then and
there, as I was looking out over the sea-like expanse of fertile
country spreading away so far under those ample skies, that the
opening lines of the hymn floated into my mind. When we left
Colorado Springs the four stanzas were pencilled in my note-book,
together with other memoranda, in verse and prose, of
the trip. The Wellesley work soon absorbed time and attention
again, the note-book was laid aside, and I do not remember
paying heed to these verses until the second summer following,
when I copied them out and sent them to <i>The Congregationalist</i>,
where they first appeared in print July 4, 1895. The hymn
attracted an unexpected amount of attention. It was almost at
once set to music by that eminent composer, Silas G. Pratt, and
re-published with his setting, in <i>Famous Songs</i>, issued in 1895
by the Baker and Taylor Company. Other tunes were written
for the words and so many requests came to me, with still increasing
frequency, to permit its use in various publications
and for special services that, in 1904, I re-wrote it, trying to
make the phraseology more simple and direct.</p>
<p>The new form first appeared in the <i>Evening Transcript</i> of
Boston, November 19, 1904. After the lapse of a few years, during
which the hymn had run the gauntlet of criticism, I
changed the wording of the opening quatrain of the third stanza.
The hymn as printed above is the final version, of which I
retain the copyright, not as a matter of money-making, for I
have given hundreds, perhaps thousands, of free permissions
for its use, but in order to protect it from misprints and conscious
alterations.</p>
<p>But here comes a difficulty. Over sixty original settings,
some of them by distinguished musicians, have been written for
the hymn, which thus suffers from an embarrassment of riches.
It is associated with no one tune. The original setting which
has, thus far, won widest acceptance is that of the former
Municipal Organist of Portland, Will C. MacFarlane (sold by
Cressey and Allen, 534 Congress Street, Portland, Maine). His
tune, which is played on the city chimes of Springfield, Mass.,
he has made the theme of a spirited march, <i>America the Beautiful</i>,
arranged for band music. In an octavo published by
Oliver Ditson Company are included four settings, one by Clarence
G. Hamilton, professor of music at Wellesley College, and
another by W. W. Sleeper, formerly pastor of the Wellesley
Congregational Church. Both these settings have found favor
with choruses and made their way into various hymnals. This
octavo carries, also, settings by William Arms Fisher, musical
editor of the Boston house of Ditson. Other tunes that have a
strong following are those of the celebrated composer, Horatio
W. Parker (in the <i>Methodist Sunday School Hymnal</i>), Charles
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
S. Brown (in <i>Junior Carols</i>, Society of Christian Endeavor),
John Stainer (in the <i>Pilgrim Hymnal</i>), J. A. Demuth, professor
of music at Oberlin (in <i>Oberlin&rsquo;s Favorite Hymns</i>, published
by Arthur P. Schmidt), and Herbert G. Peabody of Fitchburg,
Mass., (published by H. W. Gray Company of New York).
Other attractive settings, published, privately printed or yet in
manuscript, have their special circles, and the words have been
fitted to various old tunes, as those of <i>Auld Lang Syne</i>, <i>The
Harp that Once through Tara&rsquo;s Halls</i>, <i>The Son of God goes
forth to War</i> and <i>O Mother Dear Jerusalem</i>. To this last, Materna,
by S. A. Ward, in many hymnals and well known
throughout the country, <i>America the Beautiful</i> is at present
most often sung.</p>
<p>That the hymn has gained, in these twenty odd years, such
a hold as it has upon our people, is clearly due to the fact that
Americans are at heart idealists, with a fundamental faith in
human brotherhood.</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">MATERNA</span> (Mother) was composed for &ldquo;O mother dear,
Jerusalem.&rdquo; The composer, Samuel Ward, 1847-1903, resided at Newark,
N. J., where he operated a successful music business and was for
14 years the director of the Orpheus Club. The tune has by popular
preference become inseparably associated with the words.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_344">344. My country, &rsquo;tis of thee</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Samuel F. Smith</i>, 1808-95</div>
<p>The best loved of our patriotic hymns, widely used, and deeply imbedded
in the American soul.</p>
<p>His Harvard classmate, Oliver Wendell Holmes, saluted Smith in a
poem written for their class reunion on the 30th anniversary of their
graduation as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And there&rsquo;s a nice youngster of excellent pith&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Fate tried to conceal him by naming him Smith:</p>
<p class="t0">But he shouted a song for the brave and the free&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Just read on his medal, &ldquo;My country,&rdquo; &ldquo;of thee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The inspiration for this hymn came from the reading of a German
patriotic poem sent him by Lowell Mason (See <a href="#hymn_348">348</a>). The author, then
a young student at Andover Theological Seminary, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I instantly felt the impulse to write a patriotic hymn of my
own, adapted to the tune. Picking up a scrap of waste paper
which lay near me, I wrote at once, probably within half an
hour, the hymn, &ldquo;America,&rdquo; as it is now known everywhere.
The whole hymn stands today as it stood on the bit of waste
paper.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>The hymn was first sung at a children&rsquo;s festival in Park Street
Church, Boston, July 4, 1832.</p>
<p>For comments on the author, Samuel F. Smith, see <a href="#hymn_324">Hymn 324</a>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">AMERICA</span> is also the tune used with the national anthem of
Britain, &ldquo;God save the king.&rdquo; The melody is of obscure origin. It has
been known in England for several centuries. In Denmark it was used
toward the end of the 18th century for a national hymn, &ldquo;<i>Heil dir dem
liebenden</i>,&rdquo; and in Germany it was widely used in Prussian and other
northern states to patriotic words. In earlier days in the United States,
the words, &ldquo;Come Thou Almighty King,&rdquo; were sung to this tune. The
tune has thus nearly come to be an International Anthem.</p>
<p>Henry Carey, 1692-1743, an English musician of considerable ability,
known as the composer of the song, &ldquo;Sally in Our Alley,&rdquo; is sometimes
credited with this tune but the evidence is disputed. He wrote songs
and poems for light and burlesque operas but always with regard for
decency and good manners. His life was ended by suicide.</p>

<div class="author"><i>Henry Scott Holland</i>, 1874-1918</div>
<p>A prayer for the nation.</p>
<p>The hymn was written with the English Empire in mind, but its
message and concern for the removal of national evils are such as to
make it appropriate for use nearly everywhere.</p>
<p>Henry Scott Holland had a distinguished career at Oxford and attained
to numerous positions of responsibility in the Church of England.
He was Professor of Divinity at Oxford and later Canon of St.
Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral. The two chief interests of his fruitful life were social
reform and missionary work, both of which are embodied in this, his
only hymn. The poem was published in July, 1902, in <i>The Commonwealth</i>,
a Christian social magazine which Dr. Holland edited, and was
included in the <i>English Hymnal</i> in 1906.</p>

<div class="author"><i>James Russell Lowell</i>, 1819-91</div>
<p>A powerful hymn of national righteousness, taken from Lowell&rsquo;s
poem called &ldquo;The Present Crisis,&rdquo; 1845, the crisis being the war with
Mexico which the author held to be unjust and would only result in enlarging
the area of slavery. To make the meter of the poem regular
enough to be sung, some alteration was inevitable.</p>
<p>James Russell Lowell graduated from Harvard in 1838 and was admitted
to the bar two years later. He succeeded Longfellow as Professor
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
of Modern Languages and Literature in Harvard, in 1855. From
1857 to 1862 he edited the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> and the nine years following
that he was editor of the <i>North American Review</i>. In 1877 he
was appointed minister to Spain, and in 1881, to England, remaining
at the latter post four years. He wrote various volumes of poetry and
was a prominent anti-slavery writer both in verse and prose.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">TON-Y-BOTEL</span>, also known as &ldquo;Ebenezer,&rdquo; is a &ldquo;solemn
tune, of very simple structure, being formed, throughout, of imitations
of the first bar.&rdquo; A letter from the copyright owners, W. Gwenlyn
Evans and Son, Caernarvon, Wales, written by A. Vaughan Evans,
throws interesting light on this tune and the origin of the fictitious
story which gave rise to the name <span class="small">TON-Y-BOTEL</span>. It reads, in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... We have pleasure in granting permission to use the
tune Ebenezer (Ton-Y-Botel) free of charge in the Mennonite
Hymn Book.... It is an original Welsh composition by T.
J. Williams ... and was part of a Memorial Anthem &lsquo;<i>Goleu
yn y Glyn</i>&rsquo; (Light in the Vale) in memory of a friend of the
composer....</p>
<p>You will have noticed above that the correct name of the
tune is Ebenezer and it may be of interest to learn how it acquired
the &lsquo;nickname&rsquo; Ton-Y-Botel (the bottle tune). Not long
after the Welsh Revival of 1904 the tune spread all over Wales
and then England and Scotland &lsquo;by ear.&rsquo; There were no written
or printed copies of it. A crowd of young men were singing
it on a hilltop just outside this town of Caernarvon and the
usual questions were asked: Who was the composer, etc., when
a lad for a joke said the tune had been found in a bottle
washed up by the tide on the beach at Dinas Dinlle (a small
bathing place in the Irish Sea near here). Ever since the tune
has been called by the Welsh equivalent of &ldquo;Bottle Tune.&rdquo; One
of the young men made a written copy of the music as it was
sung all over the country, and brought it to us to print. The demand
was enormous and we published hundred of thousands
of copies.... We purchased the copyright and now the tune
appears in hymnals all over the world&mdash;except in Wales, the
country of its origin. I do not think it is a case of the prophet
being without honour in his own country, but rather that the
popularity was so great that it was sung everywhere&mdash;in taverns
and public houses, non-religious words were sung to it, etc.&mdash;with
the result that the tune was regarded as not quite &lsquo;respectable&rsquo;
by the generation which produced it. No doubt it
will be valued by later generations of Welsh people. This has
happened with several of the best-known Welsh hymns as
many of them 200 years ago were of secular origin.</p>
<p>I am giving the above details so that something of its history
may be on record in the United States, and hope they may
be of interest.</p>

<p>A fourth stanza, identical with the first, follows.</p>
<p>It was written by the German song writer, Siegfried Augustus Mahlmann,
and published in G. W. Fink&rsquo;s <i>Musikalischer Hausschatz</i>, 1842.
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
The hymn was first sung Nov. 13, 1815, in the presence of the King of
Saxony. The hymn was also the inspiration for Samuel F. Smith&rsquo;s,
&ldquo;My country &rsquo;tis of thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The translation was made in 1834 by Charles T. Brooks, while a
student at the Divinity School at Cambridge, Mass. It was revised by
John Sullivan Dwight, 1813-93, to form our version. Dwight was a graduate
of Harvard Divinity School and became a Unitarian minister in
Northampton, Mass., but gave up the ministry to devote himself to
literature and music. For thirty years he owned and edited Dwight&rsquo;s
<i>Journal of Music</i>.</p>
<p>The third stanza, raising the hymn above any narrow patriotism, was
added by William E. Hickson, an English shoe manufacturer who retired
from that business to pursue literary and philanthropic interests.
Much interested in the musical culture of his people, he published
various books on music and composed numerous musical works of merit.
For a time he was editor of the <i>Westminster Review</i>.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_351">351. God the All-Merciful</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Henry F. Chorley</i>, 1808-72</div>
<p>A touching cry for peace, based on the Russian national hymn by
Chorley. This paraphrase was written by John Ellerton, in 1870, during
the Franco-Prussian War. It was published in <i>Church Hymns</i> in
1871.</p>
<p>Henry F. Chorley, an English man of letters, received his education
at the Royal Institution, Liverpool. He was a literary and music critic
and a friend and great admirer of Charles Dickens. For 34 years he
was on the editorial staff of the <i>Athenaeum</i>, published in London.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">RUSSIAN HYMN</span> was composed for the words, &ldquo;God save the
Czar,&rdquo; the national Russian anthem written in 1833. It is a stately,
powerful tune which most congregations love to sing, especially after
it has been used often enough to overcome certain of its difficulties. It
was written at the command of the Czar who ordered it adopted for
the army. But there is nothing about the tune itself to render it inappropriate
for the churches. In his <i>Memoirs</i>, Lwoff says that in composing
this tune he &ldquo;felt and fully appreciated the necessity of accomplishing
something which would be robust, stately, stirring, national in
character, something worthy to reverberate either in a church, through
the soldiers&rsquo; ranks, or amongst a crowd of people, something which
would appeal alike to the lettered and the ignorant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The composer, Alexis T. Lwoff, 1799-1871, was an eminent Russian
musician, succeeding his father in St. Petersburg as head of the imperial
choir where he not only maintained the traditions of that great organization,
but raised it to still greater heights of eminence. He composed
violin concertos, operas, and church music. Lwoff had a thorough
understanding of the canonical services of the Russian Church, and his
collection of ritual chants is still considered authoritative.</p>

<p>A good peace hymn.</p>
<p>The author, William Merrill Vories, was born in Leavenworth, Kansas.
He is the founder of an independent mission in the province of
Omi, Japan. Vories published the present poem February, 1909, in the
<i>Advocate of Peace</i>. Since that time, it has found a place in a number
of hymn books. The copyright, appropriately enough, is held by the
American Peace Society.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">PENTECOST</span>, a dignified tune, simple in structure, was first
used with the hymn, &ldquo;Veni Creator,&rdquo; and appeared in <i>Thirty-two Hymn
Tunes, Composed by Members of the University of Oxford</i>, 1868. It
was revised by Arthur Sullivan who set it to Monsell&rsquo;s hymn, &ldquo;Fight
the good fight with all thy might,&rdquo; for the tune lends itself to spirited
rendition as well as the more devotional and contemplative as required
by the present hymn.</p>
<p>The composer, Rev. William Boyd, 1847-1928, was born in Jamaica
and educated at Oxford where Baring-Gould was his tutor. The latter
asked him to compose a tune to &ldquo;Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire,&rdquo;
for a meeting of Yorkshire coal miners on the Day of Pentecost. The
result was this tune to which he gave the name <span class="small">PENTECOST</span>. Boyd was
ordained priest in 1882 and from 1893 until his retirement in 1918, he
was vicar of All Saints, Norfolk Square, London.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_354">354. Father eternal, Ruler of creation</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Laurence Housman</i>, 1865&mdash;</div>
<p>One of the hymns of our time in which, characteristically, the international
note is struck. It was written at the request of the Rev. H. R.
L. (Dick) Sheppard, minister of St. Martin&rsquo;s-in-the-Fields, London, for
the Life and Liberty movement after World War I. The bitter experiences
of that war, with the subsequent fear and distrust among the
nations, had intensified the longing for the realization of the petition
in the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, &ldquo;Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.&rdquo;
This hymn gives utterance to that longing.</p>
<p>Laurence Housman is an English artist known chiefly for his book
illustrations, but he is also known as a writer of poetry and prose of
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
merit. A contemporary wrote of him: &ldquo;He has the heart of compassion
for the little ones of the earth, the dumb and the helpless, that
ought to be, but is not always, an essential part of poetry. His is the
true Franciscan spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">OLD 124TH</span> is from the <i>Genevan Psalter</i>, 1551, where it is
set to Psalm 124. It is commonly attributed to L. Bourgeois (See <a href="#hymn_34">34</a>).
The tune has always been popular in England with the non-conformist
churches and is one of the few surviving tunes from the <i>Old Version
Psalter.</i></p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_355">355. Not alone for mighty empire</h3>
<div class="author"><i>William Pierson Merrill</i>, 1867&mdash;</div>
<p>A hymn of thanksgiving and of the higher patriotism, glorying not in
empire nor in battleship and fortress but in the things of the spirit
which have made America great. It was first printed in <i>The Continent</i>,
a Presbyterian paper, now defunct, published in Chicago.</p>
<p>Concerning the origin of the hymn, Dr. Merrill wrote in a letter
dated April 18, 1947:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The occasion for the writing of this hymn was a Union
Thanksgiving Service in Chicago, where Jenkin Lloyd Jones
made a prayer, in which he thanked God more for spiritual
values in our national life than for any temporal ones. That
prayer inspired my hymn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Howard Chandler Robbins, Professor of Pastoral Theology in the
General Theological Seminary, New York City, says: &ldquo;On Thanksgiving
Day we all ought to be singing Dr. Merrill&rsquo;s great Thanksgiving
hymn, one of the greatest national hymns in the English language.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Based on Luke 19:9: &ldquo;This day is salvation come to this house,&rdquo; the
poem originally bore the title, &ldquo;Salvation is come to this house.&rdquo; It is
probably the best hymn ever written on the Christian home.</p>
<p>The author of the hymn enjoyed a singularly happy and peaceful
home life, not only under the parental roof, but also after he was married
and had established his own home. Carl Spitta, Lutheran minister
and greatest German hymn writer of the nineteenth century, was born
in Hannover. His father came from a Huguenot family that fled France
during the Catholic persecutions and died when Carl was only four
years old. His mother was a Christian Jewess whose loving care no
doubt inspired the son to write this hymn on the home. After completing
his theological studies in 1824, Spitta taught school for four
years and then was ordained in 1828 to the Lutheran ministry. He
passed through a deep spiritual experience about this time which resulted
in the composition of his finest hymns. &ldquo;In the manner in
which I formerly sang,&rdquo; he wrote a friend in 1826, &ldquo;I sing no more.
To the Lord I dedicate my life, my love, and likewise my song. He
gave to me song and melody. I give it back to Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His hymns were received with enthusiasm and held in the same
esteem in Germany as Keble&rsquo;s <i>Christian Year</i> in England. His collection
of hymns, <i>Psalter und Harfe</i>, first published in 1833, passed
through more than 50 editions and a second collection printed in 1843
had by 1887 passed through 42 editions.</p>
<p>Spitta had a family of seven children, one of whom became Professor
of New Testament Exegesis and Practical Theology in the University of
Strassburg, and another, John August Spitta, wrote the monumental
four-volume work on the life of J. S. Bach.</p>
<p>The translator of the hymn, Sarah Findlater, also knew the blessings
of a happy home. Her daughter wrote concerning her mother:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Her home life with my father was almost idyllically happy, in
the small manse at Lochearnhead, where there never was
enough of money, yet where my parents exercised unceasing
hospitality&mdash;almost foolish hospitality. They were both great
readers, and used to read aloud to each other for hours. My
mother was an excellent linguist, and her German translations
were a great pleasure to her. That simple little hymn of hers
which begins &ldquo;O happy home,&rdquo; is really an epitome of her
home life with my father&mdash;they were so single-eyed in their longing
to serve God: it came first with them always.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_365">365. God be with you till we meet again</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Jeremiah E. Rankin,</i> 1828-1904</div>
<p>Written for the purpose of a Christian good-by.</p>
<p>The author, Jeremiah E. Rankin, was pastor of the First Congregational
Church in Washington, D. C., when he wrote this hymn. Later,
in 1889, he became president of Howard University, a Negro institution
in the same city. He was always a friend of the colored people
and did what he could for their advancement.</p>
<p>He has given us the origin of the hymn as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Written in 1882 as a Christian good-by, it was called forth
by no person or occasion, but was deliberately composed as a
Christian hymn on the basis of the etymology of &ldquo;good-by,&rdquo;
which is &ldquo;God be with you.&rdquo; The first stanza was written and
sent to two composers&mdash;one of unusual note, the other wholly
unknown and not thoroughly educated in music. I selected
the composition of the latter, submitted it to J. W. Bishoff (the
musical director of a little book we were preparing), who approved
of it but made some criticisms which were adopted. It
was sung for the first time one evening in the First Congregational
Church in Washington, of which I was then the pastor
and Mr. Bishoff the organist. I attributed its popularity in no
little part to the music to which it was set. It was a wedding
of words and music, at which it was my function to preside; but
Mr. Tomer should have his full share of the family honor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">FAREWELL</span> was composed by William G. Tomer, 1832-96, an
American journalist who made music his avocation. In early life he
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
taught school, later becoming the editor of the <i>Hunterdon Gazette</i> at
High Ridge, New Jersey. The hymn he helped make famous was sung
at his funeral by a large assembly of friends and neighbors.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_366">366. Uplift the song of praise</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Frederick L. Hosmer,</i> 1840-1929</div>
<p>A hymn of praise for God&rsquo;s leading of our forefathers. The author
traced his own descent from the Pilgrim Fathers, one of his ancestors,
James Hosmer, having come to Concord in 1635. In writing the
hymn, he had the Pilgrims in mind, but his words are fully as applicable
to other immigrant groups such as the Mennonites who came at
different times from Europe to settle here in &ldquo;lands untrod.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leonard Bacon, son of missionaries to the Indians at the then frontier
trading post of Detroit, graduated from Yale and Andover Theological
Seminary. He was minister of the Center Congregational Church,
New Haven, for the forty-one years from 1825 to 1866 and professor
and lecturer at Yale Divinity School from 1866 till his death in 1881.

<div class="author"><i>Milton S. Littlefield</i>, 1864-1934</div>
<p>A hymn on the sacredness of work, connecting Jesus with the labor
of mankind. The emphasis on the social aspect of religion in terms of
our common life is a dominant note in twentieth-century hymnody.</p>
<p>The author, Milton S. Littlefield, was born in New York City; educated
at Johns Hopkins and Union Theological Seminary; and became
an honored and prominent Presbyterian minister. Recognized as an
authority in the field of hymnology, he edited two hymn books and
was elected president of the American Hymn Society, 1927-28. Besides
the present hymn, he wrote another beginning with the line, &ldquo;Come,
O Lord, like morning sunlight.&rdquo; Both are serviceable hymns, and it is
singular that neither found its way into the Presbyterian <i>Hymnal</i>,
1933.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">BROOKFIELD.</span> This tune first appeared in the <i>Congregational
Church Hymnal</i>, London, 1887, edited by Dr. E. J. Hopkins (See <a href="#hymn_43">43</a>).
The book contained the best hymn tunes for congregational singing
then available.</p>
<p>The composer, Thomas Bishop Southgate, 1814-68, received his
musical education under Sir John Goss and Samuel S. Wesley. For
many years he was organist at St. Anne&rsquo;s Church, London.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_374">374. Though lowly here our lot may be</h3>

<p>A hymn on the dignity of all work which is done through faith and
trust in Christ.</p>
<p>The author, William Gaskell, studied at Glasgow University and
Manchester College, York, and became a Unitarian minister. His one
and only charge was Cross Street Chapel, Manchester. He became Professor
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
of English History and Literature in Manchester New College
and was an influential leader in the community in the promotion of
education and culture. His denomination bestowed upon him its
highest honors. Mrs. Gaskell, a woman of brilliance and unusual literary
gifts was encouraged by her husband to engage in literary work to
distract her mind from the grief caused by the death of their little son.
She turned out to be a popular writer, publishing works of fiction
and the life of Charlotte Bront&euml;. A memorial to her bears testimony
to her genius, and to the &ldquo;tenderness and fidelity&rdquo; with which
she adorned the minister&rsquo;s home. Gaskell, a pioneer in social reform,
wrote this hymn sometime before 1860.</p>

<h4 class="b">HARVEST AND THANKSGIVING</h4>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_375">375. We plow the fields, and scatter</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Matthias Claudius</i>, 1740-1815</div>
<p>This is one of the finest harvest hymns.</p>
<p>In 1783 Claudius wrote a sketch called, &ldquo;Paul Erdman&rsquo;s Feast,&rdquo; in
which there is an interesting picture of a harvest thanksgiving celebration
in the home of a North German farmer. The farm folk gather
at the house of Erdman and as they do so they sing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Wir pfl&uuml;gen und wir streuen</p>
<p class="t0">Den Samen auf das Land,</p>
<p class="t0">Doch Wachstum und Gedeihen</p>
<p class="t">Steht nicht in unserer Hand.</p>
<p class="t">Alle gute Gabe</p>
<p class="t">Kommt oben her, von Gott</p>
<p class="t0">Vom sch&ouml;nen blauen Himmel herab.</p>
</div>
<p>Matthias Claudius, son of a Lutheran pastor in Germany, became
distinguished in journalism and literature. He studied theology with
a view of entering the ministry; but through the influence of the
rationalistic teachings in Germany at the time, he lost interest in religion
and decided to take up journalism. Later, stricken with a critical
illness, he realized the spiritual emptiness of the life he had been
living, and again turned to his childhood faith. In the lyrics he wrote,
though not composed as church hymns, there may be observed a transition
from the spiritual impoverishment of the rationalistic period to
a new type of religious poetry giving expression to a turning once
more to the rugged faith of evangelicalism.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>The hymn was translated by Jane Campbell, 1817-78, a successful
teacher of music to children. She published a <i>Handbook for Singers</i> in
which are found the musical exercises the author used in her work
with London children. The original hymn is in 17 four-line verses.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">WIR PFL&Uuml;GEN</span> appeared in <i>Lieder f&uuml;r Volksschulen</i>, a collection
of melodies for public schools, published, 1800, in Hannover. It was
set to an arrangement of verses 3-10 of Claudius&rsquo; song, with the chorus
sung by peasants, altered to suit the melody. The hymn has ever since
been extraordinarily popular throughout Germany. &ldquo;The tune, in
spite of its wide compass, has become one of the best known and
favored of all hymn tunes, and fully deserves its popularity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After tracing his grief through successive Christmas celebrations, the
poet bursts into this song of confident faith in God at the opening

<div class="author"><i>John W. Chadwick</i>, 1840-1904</div>
<p>This poem came from the Unitarian stream of hymnody which was
so strong during the middle of the nineteenth century. Chadwick, born
at Marblehead, Mass., graduated from Harvard in 1864 and the following
40 years served as minister of the Second Unitarian Church in
Brooklyn. He wrote biographies of Channing and Parker and is the
author of considerable poetry. It has been noted that many of his
hymns possess the simplicity and spirit of the writings of Whittier, the
Quaker poet, and might easily pass for his.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">HOLY CROSS.</span> The source of this tune is not clear. It is ascribed
in various hymnals to Thomas Hastings, to Mendelssohn, to
John Stainer, and to Mozart. James Love, who was well informed on
English hymn tunes, says that it was adapted from an anonymous organ
&ldquo;Andante&rdquo; which was said to be based on a theme by Mozart. The
tune, in 3-4 time, appears in the <i>Methodist Hymnal</i>, 1935, the arrangement
credited to James C. Wade, an organist and conductor of choral
groups, born in Staffordshire, England, 1847.</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">TALLIS</span>, also called &ldquo;Tallis&rsquo; Ordinal,&rdquo; is from <i>The Whole
Psalter translated into English Metre, which contayneth an hundreth
and fifty Psalmes</i>, a work by Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury,
printed about 1561. At the end of the book are nine tunes in
four parts by Thomas Tallis. This is the last of the nine and is set to
the version of <i>Veni Creator Spiritus</i>, which appears in the <i>English
Prayer Book Ordinal</i>. The tune was evidently derived by Tallis from
a 15th-century English carol tune, &ldquo;This endris Nyght&rdquo;&mdash;for it is an
adaptation to common time of the first two lines of this carol melody.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_385">385. The glory of the spring, how sweet</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Thomas Hornblower Gill</i>, 1819-1906</div>
<p>Based on Psalm 104:30: &ldquo;... thou renewest the face of the earth,&rdquo;
and Ephesians 4:23: &ldquo;... be renewed in the spirit of your mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is an exquisite lyric, expressing not only the glory of the springtime
with its newborn life, but depicting also, with rare beauty and
power, the renewal of life which God works in the soul&mdash;a new birth of
faith and love, prayer and song. The author himself wrote that, as a
result of the study of the New Testament, &ldquo;truth upon truth brake upon
my gaze and God put a new song into my mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas Hornblower Gill, born in Birmingham, England, was
brought up a Unitarian, but, unsatisfied with the Unitarian view of
the person of Christ, he withdrew from that church and joined the
Evangelical party in the Church of England. One of the major influences
leading him to this decision was his study of the hymns of Isaac
Watts. He saw &ldquo;the contrast between their native force and fulness and
their shrunken and dwindled presentation in the mutilated version in
Unitarian hymnbooks.&rdquo; Gill published a number of books of poems
which R. W. Dale, in compiling a hymnbook for his congregation at
Carr&rsquo;s Lane, Birmingham, found &ldquo;a very mine of wealth.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_388">388. Father of men, in whom are one</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Henry Cary Shuttleworth</i>, 1850-1900</div>
<p>A deeply sympathetic Christian hymn, written for the Friendly Societies
of the Church of England, but may appropriately be used for
many occasions of a more general character. It is especially useful in
the life of a college campus.</p>
<p>The author, Henry Cary Shuttleworth, was educated at Oxford for
the Anglican ministry. He was a minor canon in St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral,
1876-84, and rector of St. Nicholas Cole Abbey, London, from 1883.
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">227</span>
Concerned for the poor and down-trodden of London, Shuttleworth
became a prominent member of the Christian Social movement. For a
time he was Professor of Pastoral and Liturgical Theology in King&rsquo;s
College, London. An able musician, he wrote many carols and
hymns and published a book, <i>The Place of Music in Public Worship</i>.
The present hymn appeared in the St. Nicholas Cole Abbey <i>Hymnal
Appendix</i>, 1897, and in the <i>Church Monthly</i>, 1898, with music by the
author.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ST. LO</span> is a unique melody, constructed on three phrases of
three measures each. It is a simple, diatonic tune, moving within the
pitch range of a sixth, with the third phrase a repetition of the first.
It should be sung in a quiet manner, and is well adapted for unison
singing. The tune, an old Breton melody, appeared in <i>School Worship</i>,
London, 1926, from whence it was introduced into the <i>Presbyterian
Hymnal</i> of 1935 and from thence to the <i>Hymnary</i>.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_389">389. O grant us light that we may know</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Lawrence Tuttiett</i>, 1825-97</div>
<p>A prayer for the light from God to illuminate the mind in its search
for truth.</p>
<p>The author wrote many of his hymns on returning from visiting the
sick and bereaved, expressing in them thoughts of consolation for
families in sorrow and trouble. That this hymn may have had a similar
origin is indicated by the omitted Stanzas 4 and 5, which are as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O grant us light, in grief and pain,</p>
<p class="t">To lift our burdened hearts above,</p>
<p class="t0">And count the very cross a gain,</p>

<p>Lawrence Tuttiett, son of a surgeon in the English Royal Navy, at
first intended to follow his father into the medical profession, but,
after studying at Christ&rsquo;s Hospital and King&rsquo;s College, London, he decided
to become a minister. He was ordained in 1848 and devoted his
life to the Episcopal Church, ministering in various parishes in England
and Scotland. His publications include <i>Hymns for Churchmen</i>,
1854; <i>Hymns for Children of the Church</i>, 1862; and <i>Gems of Thought
on the Sunday Services</i>, 1864. The present hymn appeared in the last-named

<div class="author"><i>Melancthon Woolsey Stryker</i>, 1851-1929</div>
<p>&ldquo;A College Hymn&rdquo; was the title given this poem, first printed in <i>The
New York Evangelist</i>, February 27, 1896. It was included in <i>The College
Hymnal</i>, New York, the same year and in the <i>Methodist Hymnal</i> of
1905.</p>
<p>The author, Melancthon Woolsey Stryker, a prominent Presbyterian
minister, was educated at Hamilton College, New York, and Auburn
Theological Seminary. After serving churches in Auburn and Ithaca,
New York; Holyoke, Mass.; and Chicago, Ill., he became president of
his Alma Mater, Hamilton College. A student of hymnology, he compiled
several hymnals and books of sacred songs.</p>
<p>The hymn is appropriately used for commencement programs at
Christian colleges. On such occasions it is often sung to the familiar
tune &ldquo;Azmon&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_397">397</a>).</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">PATTEN</span> was written for this hymn for use in <i>The Methodist
Hymnal</i>, 1905. The composer, Peter C. Lutkin, 1858-1931, the youngest
of six children, was born of Danish parents, at Thompsonville, Wis.,
March 27, 1858. He was only a lad when both his parents died, shortly
after the family had moved to Chicago. His ability at the organ and his
success as boy soloist at the Protestant Episcopal Cathedral in Chicago
opened to him attractive opportunities for the study of music, and he
advanced rapidly. After teaching piano at Northwestern University for
several years, he left for Europe to study music in Berlin, Paris, and Vienna,
returning after four years to Chicago where he held various positions
as organist and choirmaster. In 1896, he organized the Northwestern
University School of Music and was given the title of &ldquo;Dean.&rdquo; An
authority in the field of church music and hymnology, Dean Lutkin did
much through his teaching and writing to raise the standards of music
throughout all the churches.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_391">391. I feel the winds of God today</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Jessie Adams</i>, 1863&mdash;</div>
<p>For many years the authorship of this hymn was unknown since the
writer preferred to remain anonymous. It finally came to light that the
lines were penned by Miss Jessie Adams, a member of the Society of
Friends in England. She was a progressive teacher and a leader of the
local Adult School at Frimley, England, where she long resided. Miss
Adams wrote the hymn after a long period of service as teacher in
which she felt a considerable measure of disappointment and failure,
<span class="pb" id="Page_229">229</span>
as if tugging and laboring at the oars of a boat without making much
headway. She wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If then, quitting the labors at the oars, we humbly believe
that God&rsquo;s Spirit still leads us aright, we shall pass the point
of danger and helplessness. Some little act of kindness may
be as the upturned sail which that spirit waits to fill, in spite
of past and future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The message of the hymn is for our time. Many in our day labor at
the oars, in their own strength, only to find themselves worn and discouraged.
Progress comes by lifting the sails and permitting the invisible
power of God to carry life forward.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">HARDY NORSEMEN</span> is an anonymous Norse melody, the origin
of which has not been traced. It is a popular tune among the Dutch
Mennonites where it is often sung at their young people&rsquo;s gatherings.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_392">392. &ldquo;Are ye able,&rdquo; said the Master</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Earl Marlatt</i>, 1892&mdash;</div>
<p>Written for a consecration service at Boston University School of Religious
Education, in 1926, where the author was Professor of Religious
Education.</p>
<p>It is based on Jesus&rsquo; question of James and John, and their answer:
&ldquo;Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of and to be baptized
with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto Him,
Lord, we are able&rdquo; (Matt. 20:22).</p>
<p>The second verse came to the author&rsquo;s mind as a result of seeing the
Passion Play at Oberammergau, where he was greatly moved by the
scene where the dying thief turned to Jesus and said, &ldquo;Remember me
when Thou contest into Thy Kingdom.&rdquo; &ldquo;As Anton Lang, playing the
part of Christ, said, &lsquo;Today, shalt thou be with me in paradise,&rsquo;&rdquo; the
author writes, &ldquo;Immortality suddenly became as real to me as the sunlight
at that moment driving the clouds from the mountains, and I
knew that nothing, nothing could ever shake my faith in that vision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hymn was written for the tune &ldquo;Beacon Hill.&rdquo; The combination
of words and tune was adopted as one of the school songs of Boston
University School of Theology, whose students have carried it all over
the world. It was incorporated into the <i>Methodist Hymnal</i> of 1935,
from whence it came into the <i>Hymnary</i>.</p>
<p>Earl Bowman Marlatt, son of a Methodist minister, was born at Columbus,
Indiana. He graduated from De Pauw University and then
studied at Boston University, Harvard, Oxford, and the University of
Berlin, becoming Professor of Philosophy at Boston University in 1923
and later Professor of Religious Education in that institution.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">BEACON HILL</span> received its name from Beacon Hill, Boston,

<div class="author"><i>John Burton, the younger</i>, 1803-77</div>
<p>A hymn of dedication to Christian service, suitable for use with young
people&rsquo;s groups.</p>
<p>The author, John Burton, usually called &ldquo;the younger&rdquo; to distinguish
him from another English hymn writer of the same name, was born
and died in Stratford, England. From his 15th to 25th year he suffered
greatly from ill health but recovered sufficiently to spend the next
50 years in business as a cooper and basket-maker in his home town.
A devout Congregationalist, he served as deacon in his church and as a
Sunday school teacher for 27 years. While visiting a poor chimney
sweeper, he contracted small pox and died of that disease. He published
several volumes of religious works, including <i>One Hundred Original

Dorothy Ann Thrupp was born and reared in London where she spent
all her life. She had a special gift for writing hymns suited to the
worship experiences of children. A modest person, always avoiding
personal publicity. Miss Thrupp did not always receive full credit for
her work. This hymn is sometimes wrongly credited to H. F. Lyte.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_396">396. O Son of man, our hero</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Frank Fletcher</i>, 1870-1936</div>
<p>A hymn deeply sympathetic with the aspirations and needs of young
Christians, and appealing to the heroism of youth.</p>
<p>Frank Fletcher was Head Master of Charterhouse School, Godalming,
England, the first layman elected to such a position. He wrote these
words in 1921, while on a motor drive between London and Charterhouse.
After having been sung for some time in Charterhouse School,
the poem was sent to a church newspaper, <i>The Challenge</i>, and from
thence it found its way into the hymnals of England and America. The
word &ldquo;mate&rdquo; in the last line comes from an explanation of the trinity
given by a Bishop in answer to a working man&rsquo;s question on that subject:
&ldquo;God our Father, God our Brother, God our Mate.&rdquo; Fletcher
heard the Bishop give this answer and the phrase stuck in his mind.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">LONDONDERRY</span>, the famous Irish traditional melody, is a tune
which every congregation loves to sing. It rises gradually and skilfully
to an effective climax near the end. The tune, unfortunately, has
suffered at the hands of arrangers who have employed it, with various
degrees of merit, for many different combinations of voices and instruments.
Its appropriateness for church use is questioned only by those
who have long associated it with secular words and occasions.</p>

<div class="author"><i>Tr. Henry M. Dexter</i>, 1821-90</div>
<p>A hymn to Christ, based on a Greek poem attributed to Clement of
Alexandria, beginning with the line</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&Sigma;&tau;&#8057;&mu;&iota;&omicron;&nu; &pi;&#8061;&lambda;&omega;&nu; &#7936;&delta;&alpha;&#8182;&nu;.</p>
</div>
<p>The poem is one of two which Clement attached to his book, <i>The
Tutor</i>. Some say it is the earliest Christian hymn extant. (But see
comments on <a href="#hymn_34">Hymn 34</a>).</p>
<p>Titus Flavius Clemens, known as St. Clement of Alexandria, <i>c.</i> 170-<i>c.</i>
220, remains something of an enigmatic figure in church history. It is
not known where or exactly when he was born. He was a pagan philosopher
in his younger days. After his conversion to Christianity, he became
head of the Cathedral School at Alexandria, then the center of
Christian scholarship. Here he remained until A.D. 203 when he was
driven out by persecution under Septimus Severus. Clement then
became a wanderer and nothing is known of his later life.</p>
<p>Henry Martyn Dexter was a graduate of Yale and Andover Theological
Seminary, a Congregational minister and editor. He translated
the text of Clement&rsquo;s hymn into prose and then made a free rendering
of it into verse, in 1846. The hymn was written for use in a service in
Dexter&rsquo;s church in which he preached on the text, Deut. 32:7: &ldquo;Remember
the days of old,&rdquo; his sermon topic being, &ldquo;Some Prominent
Characteristics of the Early Christians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hymnbook editors have made a few changes in the text: &ldquo;eager
youth&rdquo; for &ldquo;tender youth&rdquo; in the first stanza; and &ldquo;let all the holy
throng&rdquo; for &ldquo;infants and the glad throng&rdquo; in Stanza 4. The third stanza,
omitted here, reads as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thou art the great High Priest;</p>
<p class="t0">Thou hast prepared the feast</p>

Church, Pittsburgh, Pa.; president of the University of South Dakota;
and teacher of history in the University of Chicago. In 1910 he
became editor of the Baptist magazine, <i>Missions</i>. He was a leader in
the Christian Endeavor movement and wrote this hymn for a Christian
Endeavor hymnal that he was then editing.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">BARNARD</span> was composed by Charlotte A. (Mrs. Charles C.)
Barnard, 1820-69, an Englishwoman who after her marriage in 1851
began composing songs and ballads under the pseudonym of &ldquo;Claribel.&rdquo;
These were very popular in their day. She composed a hymn tune,
&ldquo;Brocklesbury,&rdquo; which is widely used with the hymn, &ldquo;Jesus, tender
Shepherd, hear me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The descant was written by Professor W. H. Hohmann, head of the
music department of Bethel College. The &ldquo;descant&rdquo; is an old variation
in the use of tunes. It consists of a second melody over that of the
tune and is to be sung by a few sopranos. It is only an embellishment
<span class="pb" id="Page_234">234</span>
and should be no more than audible, otherwise it will detract from the
melody which should remain as the main center of interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Children&rsquo;s Hymn,&rdquo; in Kipling&rsquo;s <i>Puck of Pook&rsquo;s Hill</i>, published

to use the hymn in the <i>Hymnary</i> was granted by Mrs. Kipling
on condition that all eight stanzas, unaltered, be used.</p>
<p>Rudyard Kipling, famous English writer, was born in Bombay, India,
and died in Sussex, England. After receiving his education in England,
he returned to India to engage in journalism and became widely
known for his short stories, novels, children&rsquo;s books, histories, and books
of travel. The Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded him in 1907,
and he received honorary degrees from universities all over the world.
His <i>Jungle Book</i>, <i>Just-So Stories</i>, <i>Puck of Pook&rsquo;s Hill</i>, <i>Rewards and
Fairies</i> made him beloved of all children. His writings extol the virtues
of clean living and manly duty which make a nation great. However,
his passionate patriotism made him pen the unfortunate lines:</p>

<div class="author"><i>W. Russell Bowie</i>, 1882&mdash;</div>
<p>This hymn was written originally for the hymn book of the Hill
School, of Pottstown, Pa., from which the author graduated as a boy in
1900, and where he afterward taught for a year. The motto of the
school is &ldquo;Whatsoever things are true&rdquo; (Phil. 4:8). The hymn is built
around that theme.</p>
<p>W. Russell Bowie was born in Richmond, Va. After taking an A.B.
and an A.M. at Harvard and teaching for a year at the Hill School, he
spent most of three years at the Theological Seminary of Virginia, near
Alexandria, graduating with the B.D. degree in 1908. Part of his senior
year was spent in special study at Union Theological Seminary in New
York. For many years he was rector of Grace Church (Episcopal) in
New York, a post he resigned in 1939 to become Jesup Graduate Professor
of Practical Theology and Dean of Students at Union Seminary.
He is the author of a number of books, the most widely known of which
<span class="pb" id="Page_235">235</span>
is the <i>Story of the Bible</i>, published by the Abingdon-Cokesbury Press.
Among his other volumes are <i>The Children&rsquo;s Year</i>, <i>The Inescapable
Christ</i>, <i>The Master: A Life of Christ</i> (1928) and <i>Which Way Ahead</i>
(1943). In the late 1920&rsquo;s he was elected Bishop Coadjutor of Pennsylvania,

<p>Written by the pastor of the Lewin&rsquo;s Mead Unitarian Church, Bristol,
England, for use in a Sunday school anniversary, 1876, in his church.
The hymn is suitable for adults as well as for children.</p>
<p>Ambrose N. Blatchford, born in Devonshire, England, was educated
at Tavistock Grammar School and Manchester New College, London.
After serving as assistant minister at Lewin&rsquo;s Mead Unitarian Church for
ten years, he took full charge in 1876 and continued until his retirement
in 1915, an unusual record of nearly 50 years of service in one church.
He was a man of sympathy with all classes of people, possessed unusual
vitality, and was a trusted friend and pastor. Blatchford was interested
in the life and progress of the community and became one of the most
influential and most-loved men in the city.</p>

<div class="author"><i>John Henley</i>, 1800-42</div>
<p>A children&rsquo;s hymn of praise, based on Matthew 21:15-16:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful
things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and
saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased,
and said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus
saith unto them, Yea; have ye not read, Out of the mouth of
babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>The hymn was written by Rev. John Henley, an English Methodist
minister, known widely for his deep spirituality and entire consecration
to Christ. Henley gave much of his time and energy in behalf of
the suffering and poor in his parishes.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">INFANT PRAISE</span>, also known as &ldquo;Children of Jerusalem,&rdquo; first

Sunday Schools</i>, published in 1842. The hymn and tune appeared a
year later in <i>The Juvenile Harmonist: A Selection of Tunes and
Pieces for Children</i>, by Thomas Clark of Canterbury.</p>
<p>John Curwen, 1816-80, was a minister in the Independent Church
in England, and an ardent advocate of congregational singing. He
developed and promoted the Tonic Sol-Fa method of teaching to sing,
using it in his own church and schools, and lecturing upon it in various
parts of the country. Resigning his ministry on account of ill
health, in 1867, he established a printing and publishing business and
assisted in the founding of a Tonic Sol-Fa Association for the promotion
of that method of singing. Curwen compiled and edited popular
collections of songs for use in Sunday schools.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_411">411. The happy Christmas comes once more</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Nikolai F. S. Grundtvig</i>, 1783-1872</div>
<p>A charmingly fresh Christmas hymn written by the greatest of Danish
hymn writers. An omitted stanza reads:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O let us go with quiet mind,</p>
<p class="t">The gentle Babe with shepherds find,</p>
<p class="t0">To gaze on him who gladdens them,</p>
<p class="t">The loveliest flower of Jesse&rsquo;s stem.</p>
</div>
<p>Nikolai F. S. Grundtvig was born in Udby, Denmark, 1783, the son
of a Lutheran pastor. He lived in a day when rationalistic &ldquo;new theology&rdquo;
had dried up the stream of spirituality in the church. The church
worship had lost its evangelical glow, and the sermons had deteriorated
into lectures on science and domestic economy. Young Grundtvig, in
the course of his studies for the ministry, had come under the influence
of this rationalism and for a time lost all interest in religion. Various
influences opened his eyes to the spiritual poverty existing in the
church, and he became an indefatigable worker for the dawn of a new
day in the life of the people. His zeal sometimes led him into extravagances
which put him at odds with his fellow ministers, but his preaching
and writings, nevertheless, became a powerful influence in Denmark
and resulted in fresh stirring of the Spirit in the church. His
poems and hymns, entitled <i>Hymns and Spiritual Songs</i>, were published
in five volumes.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> The melody is found in a book, <i>Children&rsquo;s Voices</i>, published
by the Augsburg Press (Lutheran). No information is at hand
regarding the composer, C. Belle. The arrangement was made by E.

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">IRBY</span> was written for this hymn to be sung by voices in unison,
with harmonized accompaniment. It has become one of the best-known
hymn tunes for children, and is always associated with these
words.</p>
<p>Henry John Gauntlett, 1805-76, the composer, was an English musician
who gave up law in 1844 to devote himself to music. He became a
noted organist and prolific composer, his tunes running into thousands.
He was much in demand for editing the music of hymn books and made
a notable contribution to the promotion of hymnody of the church.
Mendelssohn said of him: &ldquo;His literary attainments, his knowledge of
the history of music, his acquaintance with acoustical laws, his marvelous
memory, his philosophical turn of mind, as well as his practical
experience, rendered him one of the most remarkable professors of the
age.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_413">413. Come hither, ye children</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Christian Schmidt</i>, 1768-1854</div>
<p>A popular Christmas song which all children love to sing.</p>
<p>Christian Schmidt was born in Dinkelsb&uuml;hl, the oldest son of the
city clerk. In 1791, he was ordained to the ministry and given the headship
of the school and made school inspector in Thannhausen at
Mindel. His was a singularly fruitful ministry in which he devoted
most of his talent to the benefit of the young people. He was in the
habit of using the hours from four until eight in the morning in writing
for young people, this being the only time of the day that he considered
his own. As a child of ten years, he was greatly impressed with
the nativity scenes which had been built in the corridors of the state
church in Dinkelsb&uuml;hl and which he saw daily during the Advent season.
The vivid recollection of this childhood experience resulted in the
composition of this beloved Christmas song for children:</p>

anything that Luther ever wrote. The words must, therefore, be

<p>The full hymn was used at first as a morning hymn throughout the
Easter season. Later it was broken up into parts for various services
during the day, as follows: <i>Aurora lucis rutilat</i>, stanzas 1-4; <i>Tristes
erant apostoli</i>, stanzas 5-8; <i>Claro paschali gaudio</i>, stanzas 9-11. A traditional
double doxology of two stanzas which varies in form but which
is always present, completes the third hymn. The subject matter follows
the Biblical narrative of the events of Easter morning.</p>
<p>The entire hymn was translated by John Mason Neale, <i>Collected
Poems of John Mason Neale</i>, London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1914,
pp. 121-122, and published in <i>The Hymnal Noted</i>, in 1852. The
full translation which has been greatly altered may also be found in
<i>Hymns Ancient and Modern</i>, pp. 198-199, in a traditional form.</p>

consisting of an original hymn and an original prayer for every evening
<span class="pb" id="Page_244">244</span>
of the month, by Burns when he was minister of the Hampstead Presbyterian
Church, London. The hymn lends itself well to dramatization.</p>
<p>James Drummond Burns received his training for the ministry at the
University of Edinburgh. When the Disruption took place in the Scottish
Church, he followed his teacher, Dr. Chalmers, into the Free
Church in 1843. For reasons of health he went to France and some
years later, his health improved, he returned to London and built up
a strong congregation at Hampstead where a church had been newly
organized. His winsome character and broadmindedness, together with
an especially beautiful voice, made his work unusually effective. He
published several books and is the author of an article on &ldquo;Hymns&rdquo; in
the eighth edition of the <i>Encyclopaedia Brittanica</i>.</p>

where he taught in various institutions, including Union Theological
Seminary and the New York Institution for the Blind. In the latter
place, the blind hymn writer, Fanny Crosby, was one of his pupils.
Root organized and conducted many music institutes and joined his
<span class="pb" id="Page_245">245</span>
brother, E. T. Root, and C. M. Cady in the publishing of music in
Chicago under the firm name, Root and Cady. He composed many
tunes for religious and secular use, and during the Civil War wrote numerous
&ldquo;war songs&rdquo; which became popular. He also wrote cantatas&mdash;<i>Under
the Palms, David, the Shepherd Boy</i>, and others&mdash;which have
been used by singing organizations all over America.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_419">419. Tell me the stories of Jesus</h3>
<div class="author"><i>W. H. Parker</i>, 1845-1929</div>
<p>A hymn for children on the life of Christ. It first appeared in <i>The
Sunday School Hymnary</i>, published in England, 1885. It was written
by William Henry Parker, a member of the General Baptist Church in
England, a layman, interested especially in Sunday school work. He
was a machinist by trade, working nearly all his life in a large lace-making
plant in Nottingham. For many years he composed hymns
for anniversary festivals in the Sunday school. These were published
in 1882 in a volume entitled, <i>The Princess Alice and Other Poems</i>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">STORIES OF JESUS</span> was written for these words and included in
a volume published by the National Sunday School Union, London.</p>
<p>The composer, Frederic Arthur Challinor, was born in Staffordshire,
England, 1866, the son of a miner. Poverty compelled him in childhood
to seek employment to supplement the family income. At the age
of ten he began working in a brick yard. Two years later he found employment
in a coal mine and then in a china manufacturing plant.
All the while he was interested in music and spent his spare time
studying harmony. By hard work and perseverance, he finally won his
Mus. Bac. degree in 1903. Challinor has composed several popular cantatas
and published more than four hundred compositions for voices.</p>

<div class="author"><i>Susan Warner</i>, 1819-85</div>
<p>A hymn for small children, which first appeared, anonymously, in
<i>The Little Corporal</i>, Chicago.</p>
<p>The author, Susan Warner, sister of Anna B. Warner (see <a href="#hymn_201">Hymn 201</a>),
was the daughter of a reputable attorney in New York State.
Her father fell into undeserved misfortune which left the daughters
as the breadwinners of the household. This burden they fulfilled
by writing stories and books. Susan&rsquo;s first book, <i>The Wide, Wide
World</i>, published in 1865 under the pseudonym of &ldquo;Elizabeth Wetherall,&rdquo;
became one of the most widely read of American novels, second in
popularity only to <i>Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin</i>. It was translated into French
and German and became a best-seller on both sides of the Atlantic.
She also wrote a number of definitely religious books for children. Like
her sister, Anna, she was buried at West Point, where the two had conducted
<span class="pb" id="Page_246">246</span>
a Bible class for many years for the cadets of the U. S. Military
Academy.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> The tune is by Edwin O. Excell, 1851-1921, an American

<p>A beautiful evening prayer, written by the author for her own children.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mary Duncan was the daughter of Rev. Robert Lundie, minister
at Kelso, England. In 1836, she married the Rev. William Wallace
Duncan, minister of the Scottish parish of Cleish. Between July and
December of 1839, the year before her death, she wrote a number of
hymns for her small children. These were published in a <i>Memoir</i> by
her mother and later issued separately&mdash;twenty-three in all&mdash;as <i>Rhymes
for My Children</i>, 1842. Mrs. Duncan, whose life ended so prematurely,
was a woman of fine intellect and lovable character, the memory of
whom has been described as one of the &ldquo;aids to the devout life&rdquo; of
Scotland in the last generation. Her sister married Dr. Horatius Bonar

<p>The tune is an arrangement by Hubert P. Main, 1839-1925, American
composer of popular Sunday school and evangelistic music, and editor
of many hymn books. For sixty years, Main was connected with the
Bigelow and Main publishing house in Chicago, now out of business.
His private library of song and hymn books, consisting of over 7,000

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_427">427. I think when I read that sweet story</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Jemima Luke</i>, 1813-1906</div>
<p>A hymn that has gone all over the world and has been learned by a
countless number of children of many nations and races. Concerning
its origin, Mrs. Luke has written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I went one day on some missionary business to the little town
of Wellington, five miles from Taunton, in a stage coach.
It was a beautiful spring morning, it was an hour&rsquo;s ride, and
there was no other inside passenger. On the back of an old envelope
I wrote in pencil the first two of the verses now so well
known, in order to teach the tune to the village school supported
by my stepmother, and which it was my province to
visit. The third verse was added afterwards to make it a missionary
hymn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jemima Luke was the daughter of Thomas Thompson, one of the
founders of the British and Foreign Sailors&rsquo; Society and a &ldquo;friend of
every good cause.&rdquo; She volunteered to do missionary work in India, but
ill health made that impossible. All her life, however, she maintained an
active interest in foreign missions. In 1843, she married the Rev. Samuel
Luke, a Congregational minister in Clifton, England.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">SWEET STORY</span> is an arrangement by Wm. B. Bradbury (see
<a href="#hymn_103">Hymn 103</a>) of a Greek tune known as &ldquo;Salamis&rdquo; or &ldquo;Athens.&rdquo; Mrs.
Luke heard the melody (in its original form) used as a marching song
by a group of children in a school near her home where she had gone
to learn something of the teaching methods used. She was intrigued by
the tune and wrote the words to fit it. The words and music are inseparably
associated, the original form of the melody being used in England,
and Bradbury&rsquo;s adaptation (easier but less interesting) in America.</p>

<div class="author"><i>Henriette Luise von Hayn</i>, 1724-82</div>
<p>A song of the Good Shepherd&rsquo;s care of His lambs, based on Isa. 40:11:
&ldquo;He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with
his arm, and carry them in his bosom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henriette Luise von Hayn, born in Idstein, Nassau, early in life
gave her heart to Christ and often rose at night to spend hours on
her knees in prayer. Influenced by the writings of Zinzendorf, she became
interested in joining the &ldquo;Brotherhood,&rdquo; against the wishes of
her parents. One morning, after reading Matthew 10:37, &ldquo;He that
loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me,&rdquo; she decided
to leave home and did so, mailing a letter in the neighboring village
to her parents explaining her intention to go to Herrnhag to join
the Moravian colony at that place. However, she was detained at
Frankfurt and returned to her home. Her parents now granted her
wish to join the Moravians and the rest of her life was spent as a useful
and influential member of the Brotherhood, first at Herrnhag and later
at Herrnhut, where she received spiritual instruction from Zinzendorf
himself. On August 8, 1776, she wrote &ldquo;Weil ich Jesu Sch&auml;flein bin,&rdquo; a
poem of seven stanzas, in honor of Sister Christine Petersen&rsquo;s thirty-sixth
birthday. Our hymn is a selection of three stanzas from this poem.</p>
<p>The German version of the poem is as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Weil ich Jesu Sch&auml;flein bin</p>
<p class="t">Freu ich mich nur immerhin</p>
<p class="t0">Ueber meinen guten Hirten</p>

<p>Wilhelm Hey was born in Laucha, near Gotha, where he later became
minister of the local parish. He received his education at Jena
and G&ouml;ttingen Universities and became a well-known writer, minister,

the parishes he served, and took much interest in the distribution of
Bibles where needed.</p>
<p>The translation was made by John R. Thierstein, Ph.D., Professor
of German and French, Bethel College, North Newton, Kansas. Dr.
Thierstein was born in Bowil, Bern, Switzerland. In addition to his
work as college professor, he served the church for a time as editor of
<i>The Mennonite</i>, and at the time of his death he was chairman of the
Board of Publications of the General Conference of Mennonites, a position

<div class="author"><i>Wm. Paton Mackay</i>, 1839-85</div>
<p>A popular song in the Moody and Sankey revivals. It has few equals
as a &ldquo;rouser&rdquo; in a revival or prayer meeting. To create interest and add
variety in a special song service, Rodeheaver suggests that the leader
try having the choir sing the chorus all the way through, the congregation
joining only in the &ldquo;Hallelujah,&rdquo; and the last phrase, &ldquo;Revive
us again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The author, Wm. Paton Mackay, received his education in the University
of Edinburgh. For some time he was interested in medicine but
gave that up to become the minister of the Prospect Street Presbyterian
Church, Hull, England. He came to an untimely death through an accident.

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ALLEN</span>, a favorite tune wherever gospel songs are in use, was

<p>A hymn built around the theme &ldquo;God is love,&rdquo; I John 4:8, 16.</p>
<p>The author is unknown.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">GOD IS LOVE.</span> This tune was composed by Rev. Edmund S.
Lorenz, a prolific writer of gospel hymn-tunes, and founder and president
of the Lorenz Publishing Company, Dayton, Ohio. Lorenz was
born in Stark County, Ohio, July 13, 1854, and received his education
at Otterbein University, Union Theological Seminary, Yale Divinity
School, and the University of Leipzig. He was a pastor in the United
Brethren Church for a time and then became president of Lebanon
Valley College, a post he was compelled to resign on account of illness.
Regaining his health, he went into the publishing business. He prepared
<i>The Church Hymnal</i> for the United Brethren in Christ in 1935. His
publications include <i>Practical Church Music</i>, <i>The Singing Church</i>,
1937, and other volumes on sacred music.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_440">440. There is no name so sweet on earth</h3>
<div class="author"><i>George W. Bethune</i>, 1805-62</div>
<p>A hymn honoring the name of Jesus. John Wesley always objected
to words like &ldquo;dear&rdquo; and &ldquo;sweet&rdquo; applied to Jesus, as being too sentimental,
and the terms are never so used in the New Testament. But the
gospel song writers have employed them frequently and many good
Christians have no hesitancy in singing them.</p>
<p>George W. Bethune was the son of a prominent merchant, philanthropist,
and churchman in New York City. On the day of his birth
he was dedicated to God by his godly parents, their prayer being that
the child may &ldquo;be made a faithful, honored and zealous minister of
the everlasting gospel.&rdquo; The son was given many educational advantages
<span class="pb" id="Page_255">255</span>
and made good use of them. He was admitted to college at 14
and graduated from Princeton Theological Seminary when only 20
years of age. After serving for a year as chaplain to the seamen in the
port of Savannah, he returned north to accept the pastorate of a Dutch
Reformed Church and later served churches in Philadelphia, Brooklyn,
and elsewhere. A man of fine literary taste and good scholarship,
he was offered, but declined, the Provostship of the University of Pennsylvania
and the Chancellorship of New York University. He preferred
to be a preacher of the Gospel. To his son and sons-in-law, he gave this
dying charge: &ldquo;My sons, preach the Gospel. Tell dying sinners of a
Saviour. All the rest is but folly.&rdquo; He went to Florence, Italy, for his
health and died there on a Sunday night after having preached in the
Scottish Church in the morning on the text, &ldquo;Be of good cheer: thy sins
be forgiven thee.&rdquo; The following poem, found in his portfolio, was
written on the Saturday before his death:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When time seems short and death is near,</p>
<p class="t">And I am pressed by doubt and fear,</p>
<p class="t0">And sins, an overflowing tide,</p>
<p class="t">Assail my peace on every side,</p>
<p class="t0">This thought my refuge still shall be,</p>
<p class="t">I know the Saviour died for me.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">His name is Jesus, and he died,</p>
<p class="t">For guilty sinners crucified;</p>
<p class="t0">Content to die that he might win</p>
<p class="t">Their ransom from the death of sin:</p>
<p class="t0">No sinner worse than I can be,</p>
<p class="t">Therefore I know he died for me.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">If grace were bought, I could not buy;</p>
<p class="t">If grace were coined, no wealth have I;</p>
<p class="t0">By grace alone I draw my breath,</p>
<p class="t">Held up from everlasting death;</p>
<p class="t0">Yet, since I know his grace is free,</p>
<p class="t">I know the Saviour died for me.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I read God&rsquo;s holy Word, and find</p>
<p class="t">Great truths which far transcend my mind;</p>
<p class="t0">And little do I know beside</p>
<p class="t">Of thoughts so high, so deep, so wide:</p>
<p class="t0">This is my best theology,</p>
<p class="t">I know the Saviour died for me.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">My faith is weak, but &rsquo;tis Thy gift;</p>
<p class="t">Thou canst my helpless soul uplift,</p>
<p class="t0">And say, &ldquo;Thy bonds of death are riven,</p>
<p class="t">Thy sins by Me are all forgiven;</p>
<p class="t0">And thou shalt live from guilt set free,</p>
<p class="t">For I, thy Saviour, died for thee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>His body was brought to New York for burial. Among the directions
he had left for his funeral was this: &ldquo;Sing my own hymn, &lsquo;It is not
death to die,&rsquo; to a cheerful tune.&rdquo; The request was carried out. The
hymn referred to is a translation he had made of a poem by the distinguished
Swiss preacher, C&eacute;sar Malan.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">SWEETEST NAME.</span> The name of the tune is obviously derived
from the words for which it was composed. For comments on the

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_441">441. Take my heart, O Father, take it</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Anonymous</i></div>
<p>A simple hymn of consecration and devotion whose author evidently
preferred to remain anonymous.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">DORRNANCE.</span> The tune is simplicity itself. Concerning his
tunes, Woodbury wrote in the preface to his <i>New Lute of Zion</i>, 1856:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The music is not designed for the fastidious and scientific
musician whose highest delight, and perhaps sole worship, is
music as an art, but for those who love to worship God in the
simple song of praise.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_442">442. &rsquo;Tis the promise of God, full salvation to give</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Philip P. Bliss</i>, 1838-76</div>
<p>A hymn with a curious origin which became popular in revival meetings.
It voices the spontaneous thanksgivings that break out at the announcement
of a conversion. Bliss wanted to include &ldquo;Hallelujah!
Thine the glory&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_437">No. 437</a>) in his <i>Gospel Songs</i>, 1874. The owner of
the copyright refused permission whereupon Bliss wrote &ldquo;Hallelujah!
&rsquo;tis done&rdquo;&mdash;both words and music&mdash;as a substitute.</p>
<p>Philip P. Bliss, a Congregationalist, born in Rome, Pa., was reared
in the country. He had only the meagerest early advantages for the
development of his musical talents but he made the most of them and
became one of the greatest leaders and writers of evangelistic songs.
Combining the gift of poet and musician, he succeeded in putting
gospel truths in poetic and singable form, usually writing both words
and music. In his early career he conducted musical conventions
throughout the Middle West, served as director of music for the First
Congregational Church in Chicago, and was connected with the music
publishing house of Root and Cady in Chicago. Through the influence
of D. L. Moody, he gave up his business and professional pursuits and
entered the evangelistic field. He assisted Sankey in the editing of the
series called <i>Gospel Hymns</i>, in which some of his own celebrated
<span class="pb" id="Page_257">257</span>
hymns and songs first appeared. His rare gifts as a singer and leader,
combined with an impressive personality, made him one of the outstanding
leaders in the evangelistic movement. His life came to an early
and tragic end December 29, 1876, in a railroad disaster near Ashtabula,
Ohio, while he and Mrs. Bliss were returning to Chicago from
Rome, Pa., where the two had spent Christmas. A railroad bridge
gave way, resulting in a wreck which took the lives of one hundred passengers.
Bliss had escaped unhurt, but going back to rescue his wife,
he was evidently overcome by the flames which had spread and was not
seen again. His premature death at the age of 38 was widely lamented.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_443">443. Come, we that love the Lord</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Isaac Watts</i>, 1674-1748</div>
<p>This hymn, entitled by Watts, &ldquo;Heavenly Joy on Earth,&rdquo; appeared
in his <i>Hymns and Sacred Songs</i>, 1707.</p>
<p>For comments on Isaac Watts, see <a href="#hymn_11">Hymn 11</a>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> The tune is by Robert Lowry, 1826-99, a Baptist minister
who held a pastorate in Brooklyn, N. Y., and did much to promote the
gospel song movement. He edited a series of eight books for Bigelow
and Main, with such titles as <i>Bright Jewels</i> and <i>Pure Gold</i>, to which
he added a large number of tunes of his own composition. The public
bought these books by the hundreds of thousands. Lowry had no
serious training in music and did not take up composition until middle
life. He was concerned mostly with the production of music which was
popularly effective.</p>
<p>Watts&rsquo; hymn appears in many hymn books with the more dignified
tune, &ldquo;St. Thomas,&rdquo; by Williams (<a href="#hymn_269">No. 269</a>).</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_444">444. I lay my sins on Jesus</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Horatius Bonar</i>, 1808-89</div>
<p>The hymn, entitled &ldquo;The Fulness of Jesus,&rdquo; was written for children
in a desire to provide something which children could sing and appreciate
in divine worship. It is generally supposed to be the first hymn
Bonar wrote. He used to say of this hymn that it might be good gospel
but that it was not good poetry. Bonar loved children and for them
his first hymns were written.</p>

<span class="pb" id="Page_258">258</span>
and appeared in <i>The Revival Hymn Book</i>, 2d series, 1863, and later
in the author&rsquo;s <i>Psalms and Sacred Songs</i>, 1866.</p>
<p>James Grindlay Small was educated at Edinburgh University where
Dr. Thomas Chalmers was one of his professors. He became minister
of a church in 1847, but owing to peculiarities of voice and manner, he
never succeeded well as a preacher. However, he was a man of fine
Christian character and had the confidence of his brethren. Small was
interested in hymnology and is the author of a number of hymns and
poems.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">FRIEND.</span> The tune was written by Stebbins while he and Dr.
Pentecost were conducting an evangelistic campaign in Providence, R. I.

<div class="author"><i>C. W. Fry</i></div>
<p>A song of the friendship of Jesus and its meaning to one who experiences
it. The words are based on Song of Songs 2:1-2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys. As the lily
among the thorns, so is my love among the daughters.&rdquo; Also on Revelation

<div class="author"><i>Marianne Nunn</i>, 1778-1847</div>
<p>A hymn on the love of Jesus, which has been used extensively as a
song for children, especially in England. It was originally written to
adapt John Newton&rsquo;s hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;One there is above all others,</p>
<p class="t0">Well deserves the name of friend,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>to the Welsh air, &ldquo;Ar hyd y nos&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_35">No. 35</a>), and the hymn may well be
sung to this tune.</p>
<p>Marianne Nunn was an English woman of refinement and culture.
She is the author of <i>The Benevolent Merchant</i>, and of several hymns.
The latter were published in <i>Psalms and Hymns</i>, 1817, a collection
<span class="pb" id="Page_259">259</span>
compiled by her brother, Rev. John Nunn, who also contributed some
of his own hymns to the same volume.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">CARITAS.</span> No information has been traced concerning Richard
W. Beaty, 1799-1883, composer of the tune. The editors of the

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_448">448. Brightly beams our Father&rsquo;s mercy</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Philip P. Bliss</i>, 1838-76</div>
<p>A song which is best understood by people living on the sea-coast
or lakeshore, or whose lives are spent in work which keeps them upon
the water.</p>
<p>The words were suggested by an illustration given by D. L. Moody
in one of his sermons:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On a dark, stormy night, when the waves rolled like mountains
and not a star was to be seen, a boat, rocking and plunging,
neared the Cleveland harbor. &ldquo;Are you sure this is Cleveland?&rdquo;
asked the captain, seeing only one light from the lighthouse.
&ldquo;Quite sure, sir,&rdquo; replied the pilot. &ldquo;Where are the
lower lights?&rdquo; &ldquo;Gone out, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Can you make the harbor?&rdquo;
&ldquo;We must, or perish, sir!&rdquo; With a strong hand and a brave
heart the old pilot turned the wheel. But, alas, in the darkness
he missed the channel, and with a crash upon the rocks the
boat was shivered, and many a life lost in a watery grave.
Brethren, the Master will take care of the great lighthouse; let
us keep the lower lights burning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">LOWER LIGHTS.</span> There is awakening power in the tune and
congregations love to sing it. It is especially effective when sung by a
large number of voices. The chorus lends itself to interesting antiphonal
effects in a special song service. Let the whole congregation
sing the first phrase, a smaller group the second; the whole congregation
again the third phrase, and the smaller group the last.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_450">450. I know whom I have believed</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Daniel W. Whittle</i>, 1840-1901</div>
<p>The hymn is built around the verse: &ldquo;I know whom I have believed,
and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed
to him against that day&rdquo; (II Tim. 1:12), which serves as a refrain. The
general structure of the hymn is similar to Farrington&rsquo;s &ldquo;I know not how
that Bethlehem&rsquo;s Babe&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_99">No. 99</a>).</p>
<p>Daniel W. Whittle was born in Chicopee Falls, Mass. At the age of
15, he went to Chicago to work in a bank, but at the outbreak of the
Civil War he became attached to the Illinois Infantry and served for
the duration, going with Sherman, as a lieutenant, on his &ldquo;March to the
Sea.&rdquo; At the close of the war he was promoted to the rank of major.
He was the treasurer of a business firm, when, in 1873, he heeded the
call of God to enter the evangelistic field where he became associated
with D. L. Moody. He was a powerful speaker and lecturer; and frequently,
with the assistance of singers like P. P. Bliss, James McGranahan,
and George Stebbins, continued evangelistic campaigns begun by
Moody, under the latter&rsquo;s direction. Whittle was a great friend of children
and knew how to put evangelical truth in words they understood,
supplementing his talks with wall maps, illustrations, and chemical
experiments. His daughter, Mary, became the wife of Will L. Moody,
son of the evangelist. He was a member of the Congregational Church.
His hymns, written after 1877, mostly for McGranahan, reveal true poetic
talent, though he made no claim to be a poet. Among his best
known hymns are: &ldquo;I know whom I have believed,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dying with Jesus,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Moment by moment,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fierce and wild.&rdquo; The latter was translated
into German by Ernst Gebhardt, translator of &ldquo;<i>Ich weiss einen Strom</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> The tune is by James W. McGranahan, 1840-1907, who succeeded
the lamented P. P. Bliss as song leader in the evangelistic campaigns
conducted by Major Whittle. Between 1881 and 1885, Whittle
and McGranahan made two successful tours of England, Scotland, and
Ireland, and the chief cities of America. McGranahan, born at Adamsville,
Pa., received only an elementary-school education. His native musical
talent and some assistance from men like Bassini, Webb, Root, and
Zerrahn enabled him to make rapid progress in music; and he soon
taught music classes of his own. He was gifted with a beautiful tenor
voice and an impressive personality to add to his power as a song
leader.</p>

<div class="author"><i>Robert Lowry</i>, 1826-99</div>
<p>The words and music of this Easter song are by Rev. Robert Lowry,
written while he was pastor of a Baptist church in Brooklyn, N. Y.</p>
<p>Lowry was a faithful and successful minister of the Gospel, but is
more widely known as a composer of sacred music. &ldquo;I felt a sort of
meanness when I began to be known as a composer,&rdquo; he said. His first
love was preaching. Music was to him a &ldquo;side issue,&rdquo; and the making
and delivery of a sermon ranked far above the writing of a hymn. He is
the author of the popular song, &ldquo;Where is my wandering boy tonight,&rdquo;
and wrote the tune to &ldquo;I need Thee every hour,&rdquo; and edited many successful
Sunday school and evangelistic hymn books.</p>

<p>A popular Easter song based on Job 19:25: &ldquo;I know that my redeemer
liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jessie H. Brown was born in Hiram, a college suburb of Cleveland,
Ohio. Due to ill health in childhood, she gained most of her education
at home. At 15 years of age, she began to write for Cleveland newspapers
and religious weeklies and for many years wrote hymns for
Fillmore Bros. In 1896 she married Rev. John E. Pounds, at that time
pastor of the Central Christian Church in Indianapolis, and later college
pastor at Hiram. Her early poems bear her maiden name, while the
later ones (<a href="#hymn_498">No. 498</a>, for example) are signed &ldquo;Jessie B. Pounds.&rdquo; She
is the author of 9 books, 50 librettos for cantatas and operettas, and
nearly 400 hymns. Her best known song poems are &ldquo;Anywhere with
Jesus, I can safely go,&rdquo; &ldquo;The way of the Cross leads home,&rdquo; &ldquo;Beautiful
Isle of Somewhere,&rdquo; and the present, &ldquo;I know that my Redeemer

in her life notwithstanding the cross of affliction laid on her through
the loss of her eyesight. Frances Ridley Havergal (See <a href="#hymn_126">Hymn 126</a>), the

<p>Will Lamartine Thompson was born at East Liverpool, Ohio, and
made his home there all his life. He attended Mt. Union College, Alliance,
Ohio, and studied music at the Boston Conservatory of Music.
His greatest interest was in sacred song, but he also wrote secular songs,

businessman and song writer, Thompson was known also as a man of
beautiful and sterling Christian character. &ldquo;Simplicity, sincerity, humility,
and righteousness marked his life.&rdquo; He once called to inquire of
D. L. Moody at a time when the latter lay very ill and visitors were
forbidden. Moody insisted that Thompson be admitted and said to him
in the course of their brief conversation: &ldquo;I would rather have written
&lsquo;Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling&rsquo; than anything I have been able
to do in my whole life.&rdquo;</p>

original refrain:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Come to Jesus, come to Jesus,</p>
<p class="t">Come to Jesus now.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>was changed by Ira Sankey to</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Only trust Him, only trust Him.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>In leading this song, Sankey sometimes changed the chorus to</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I will trust Him,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I do trust Him.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>John H. Stockton, composer of words and music, was born at New
Hope, Pa., and reared in a Presbyterian family. At the age of 19 he
was converted in a Methodist camp meeting and became a Methodist
preacher. After many years of pastoral and evangelistic work, as a
member of the New Jersey Annual Conference, he retired in 1874. He
had considerable musical ability and published two gospel song books,
<i>Salvation Melodies</i>, 1874, and <i>Precious Songs</i>, 1875. He rendered valuable
assistance in the Moody and Sankey meeting held in Philadelphia,
after which Sankey wrote him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thank my Heavenly Father for enabling you to write so
much sweet music, as well as words; and I hope you may long
be spared to bless the world with your &ldquo;precious songs.&rdquo; I
<span class="pb" id="Page_264">264</span>
wish you to accept our regards for one whose songs have been
blessed to tens of thousands in the lands beyond the seas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stockton died suddenly while talking to friends just after having attended
the morning service at Arch Street Church, Philadelphia, on
March 25, 1877.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_458">458. Just as I am, without one plea</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Charlotte Elliott</i>, 1789-1871</div>
<p>An immortal hymn expressing the feelings and needs of all penitent
believers. It has been a source of comfort and help to multitudes of
people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must come to Christ just as you are.&rdquo; These words, spoken to
Miss Elliott by Dr. C&eacute;sar Malan of Geneva, at a time when she was suffering
and spiritually depressed, resulted in a new birth and formed the
basis of her hymn, written twelve years later, in 1834, and now known
all over the world. The hymn was first published in the author&rsquo;s <i>Invalids&rsquo;
Hymn Book</i>, 1836, headed with the text, John 6:37: &ldquo;All that
the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I
shall in no wise cast out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were written one day when other members of her family
were busy arranging for a bazaar to be held for a school banquet. The
immediate circumstances are related by Dr. Handley C. G. Moule,
Bishop of Durham, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The night before the bazaar she was kept wakeful by distressing
thoughts of her apparent uselessness; and these thoughts
passed into a spiritual conflict till she questioned the reality of
her whole spiritual life and wondered whether it were anything
better, after all, than an illusion of the emotions&mdash;an illusion
ready to be sorrowfully dispelled. The next day, the busy
day of the bazaar, the troubles of the night came back upon her
with such force that she felt they must be met and conquered in
the grace of God. She gathered up in her soul the grand certainties,
not of her emotions, but of her salvation: her Lord, his
power, his promise. And taking pen and paper from the table,
she deliberately set down in writing for her own comfort the
formulae of her faith. So in verse she restated to herself the
gospel of pardon, peace, and heaven. As the day wore on, her
sister-in-law, Mrs. H. V. Elliott, came in to see her and bring
news of the work. She read the hymn and asked (she well
might) for a copy. So it first stole out from that quiet room into
the world, where now for sixty years it has been sowing and
reaping till a multitude which only God can number have been
blessed through its message.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though a helpless invalid, Miss Elliott probably did more that day
<span class="pb" id="Page_265">265</span>
for her Lord and the upbuilding of His Kingdom than the rest of the
family, all strong in body.</p>
<p>The hymn was sent to Dora Wordsworth, daughter of the poet, while
she was on her death bed. Her husband, Edward Quillinan, has written
of the incident in a letter to Miss Elliott, dated July 28, 1847. He tells
of Dora&rsquo;s appreciation of the hymn and her continual use of it during
her last days on earth.</p>
<p>After Miss Elliott died, more than a thousand letters, thanking her for
this hymn, were found.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_459">459. Come, ye sinners, poor and needy</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Joseph Hart</i>, 1712-68</div>
<p>An evangelistic song, written by a Congregational minister. Hart,
born in London and brought up in a devout Christian home, was well
educated and taught the classics for many years. Early in life he departed
from his religious training and fell into a life of &ldquo;carnal and
spiritual wickedness, irreligious and profane.&rdquo; After continuing in this
state for a long period of years, during which he exerted a pernicious
influence upon all with whom he associated, Hart became deeply convicted,
in his fortieth year, and betook himself to daily prayer and
Bible reading. He was finally converted upon hearing a sermon on
Rev. 3:10: &ldquo;Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will
keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the
world, to try them that dwell upon the earth&rdquo;&mdash;preached in the Moravian
Chapel in Fetter Lane, London. Becoming an earnest and consecrated
Christian, and writer of hymns, he was importuned to become a
preacher, which he did, although in his 48th year. From 1760 till his
death in 1768, he preached regularly as pastor of an Independent Congregation
in London, drawing large crowds. He died in the midst of
labors and successes almost unprecedented, and it is said that 20,000
people came to his funeral. He is remembered chiefly, however, for his
hymns, most of them of the evangelistic type.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">GREENVILLE</span>, a beautifully quaint and popular tune, was
not written for sacred use but for a little song in the opera <i>Le Devin du
Village</i>, by Rousseau. It was once popular in a piano arrangement
known as &ldquo;Rousseau&rsquo;s Dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean Jacques Rousseau, 1712-78, philosopher and musician, was born
at Geneva. Though not a religious man, he greatly influenced education
in Europe and became one of the great forces in modern literature. A
political radical, he was forced to leave France and for a time lived in
England. His opera, <i>Le Devin du Village</i>, was a success, but none of
his later musical efforts came to anything. He lived an unhappy life
and is thought to have committed suicide. His death occurred near
Paris, July 3, 1778.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_460">460. I have a Savior, He&rsquo;s pleading in glory</h3>
<div class="author"><i>S. O&rsquo;Maley Cluff</i></div>
<p>A favorite prayer-meeting hymn for many years, in many churches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>Sankey came across these words in a printed leaflet while he was on
his first visit with D. L. Moody to Ireland in 1874. It was the second
hymn to which he wrote music and was much used in later Moody-Sankey
revival services.</p>
<p>No definite information has been traced by hymnologists concerning
Samuel O&rsquo;Malley Clough to whom the words are attributed. He is believed
to have been an Irish clergyman who left the Established Church
to unite with the Plymouth Brethren in Ireland; later (1881) seceding
from that body to lead a &ldquo;holiness&rdquo; schism which has since become
extinct. Julian and others spell the name &ldquo;Clough&rdquo;; Sankey spells it
&ldquo;Cluff.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">CLUFF</span> derives its name from the author of the words to
which Sankey set the tune.</p>
<p>Ira David Sankey, 1840-1908, famous singer of &ldquo;gospel songs,&rdquo; was
born in Edinburg, Pa., and was a member of the Methodist Church.
For many years he was associated with D. L. Moody in evangelistic
work in America and England. He composed many gospel tunes, the
most popular of which is his &ldquo;Ninety and Nine,&rdquo; and edited numerous
songbooks. Concerning his own gift of singing and songs suited to his
purpose, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am no musician, I am no singer; I was never taught to sing....
As to my singing there is no art or conscious design in it.
I never touch a song that does not speak to me in every word
and phrase. Before I sing I must feel, and the hymn must be
of such a kind that I know I can send home what I feel into the
hearts of those who listen. I find it much more difficult to get
good words than good music. Our best words come from England;
the music which best suits our purpose comes from America.
Your composers, apparently, do not care to write simple
songs such as we need. We can get plenty of the grand and
solid style, but though that is useful now and again, our services
could not thrive on it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Homer Rodeheaver has used this song with antiphonal effects by
letting the choir sing the first phrase of the refrain, the audience responding
with the second; or, if the audience is large, letting one side,
then the other side, then the whole congregation, then the gallery sing,
successively, one phrase each of the refrain.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_461">461. A ruler once came to Jesus by night</h3>
<div class="author"><i>W. T. Sleeper</i></div>
<p>Based on our Lord&rsquo;s words to Nicodemus: &ldquo;Verily, verily, I say unto
you, ... ye must be born again&rdquo; (John 3:3-7).</p>
<p>The hymn was written by Rev. W. T. Sleeper, one of the pastors in
the city of Worcester, Mass., upon the request of Geo. C. Stebbins, who
<span class="pb" id="Page_268">268</span>
was assisting Dr. Pentecost in a revivalistic campaign in that city. One
of the latter&rsquo;s sermon themes was &ldquo;The New Birth.&rdquo; As the truth of
this great theme was being enforced and illustrated, it occurred to Stebbins
that a musical setting of this Scripture passage in John 3 would be
an effective means of emphasizing the truth of the new birth. He asked
the Rev. Sleeper to write some verses on the subject and the result was
this hymn. Before the meetings closed, Stebbins had composed this tune
for the words. The song was published in <i>Gospel Hymns, No. 3</i>, and has
been widely used as solo, choir number, and congregational song in
revival meetings and otherwise.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_462">462. I hear the Savior say</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Elvina M. Hall</i>, 1818-?</div>
<p>A much-used and much-loved revival hymn which came into use, especially
in Methodist churches, several years before Moody&rsquo;s great revivalistic
movement.</p>
<p>Mrs. Elvina M. Hall (later Mrs. Myers), author of the words, was
born in Alexandria, Va., in 1818. She composed this hymn, strangely
enough, while sitting in the choir of the M. E. Church, Baltimore, pencilling
the first draft on a fly-leaf of a hymn book, <i>The New Lute of
Zion</i>, during the pastor&rsquo;s prayer! It is the only hymn known that can be
traced to such an origin. The author&rsquo;s mind, indeed, wandered from
the immediate service of worship, but it did not stray from God and
prayer.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ALL TO CHRIST.</span> John T. Grape, born in Baltimore, Md.,
1833, was choir director in his church when he wrote the tune, after
having made it &ldquo;a matter of prayer and study.&rdquo; He writes that &ldquo;it was
pronounced very poor by my choir and my friends, but my dear wife
persistently declared it was a good piece of music and would live.&rdquo; Mrs.
Grape&rsquo;s faith was justified by the wide reception and use the tune has
enjoyed. The minister of the church, Rev. Mr. Schrick, liked the tune
upon hearing it and suggested that it be used with the words written
by Mrs. Elvina M. Hall. This was done, and the song started on its career.
It was first published in a volume called, <i>Sabbath Chords</i>.</p>

<p>The hymn reminds one of Newton&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;I can never forget two
things: first, that I was a great sinner, and second, that Jesus is a great
Saviour.&rdquo; It is based on I Chron. 17:16, 17:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<p>Who am I, O Lord God, and what is mine house, that Thou
hast brought me hitherto? And yet this was a small thing in
thine eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant&rsquo;s
house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according
to the estate of a man of high degree, O Lord God.</p>

<p>This hymn, reflecting spiritual joy, is often used at baptismal services
and is also one of the best revival hymns. It is based on II Chron. 15:15:
&ldquo;And all Judah rejoiced at the oath; for they had sworn with all
their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; ... and the Lord
gave them rest round about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The original title was &ldquo;Rejoicing in our covenant engagements to
God.&rdquo; It was published in 1819, by the author&rsquo;s great-grandson, John
Doddridge Humphreys.</p>
<p>The hymn was chosen by Prince Albert, the consort of Queen Victoria,
to be sung always on occasions when members of the royal family
were confirmed. It reflects a deep and rich experience of God. &ldquo;Blessed

<p>Erdmann Neumeister was a distinguished student and afterwards
lecturer at Leipzig University. Later he achieved fame as a court
preacher and as pastor of St. James&rsquo; Church, Hamburg. An eloquent
preacher and a strong High Lutheran, he opposed the Moravians and
the Pietists of his day, holding that their teachings were too subjective.
Besides being a gifted preacher, he was also a musician of ability
and eminence. He originated the cantata form of church music and
composed a number of works in that form. He is the author of 650
hymns, many of them of the highest rank and still in general use in
Germany though only a few have been translated into English.</p>

<p>The author had known the joy of finding Christ and his hymn reflects
his personal experience. While frequenting London, as a youth,
in a vain search for employment,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He became addicted, in consequence, to sight-seeing, song-singing,
play-going, card-playing, horse-racing, ball-frequenting,
and the like. But on an Easter visit to London, in 1735, he was
seriously impressed as he was walking hastily in Cheapside. He
became greatly distressed on account of his sins, broke off from
his sinful course, and walked softly before God; but he found
no peace until September 6, 1737, in his nineteenth year, when
he was enabled to trust in Christ alone and find joy and peace
in believing.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_477">477. Yield not to temptation</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Horatio R. Palmer</i>, 1834-1907</div>
<p>A song that has been a source of strength to many in time of temptation.</p>
<p>The words and tune are by Horatio Richmond Palmer, Mus. Doc., an
American musician born at Sherburne, New York. He studied music in
Berlin and Florence and became the director of the Rushford Academy
of Music, New York, in 1857. In 1884, he took charge of the Church
Choral Union in New York, an organization which grew to a membership
of 4,000 singers devoted to the improvement of church music. He
was dean, for a time, of the school of music at Chautauqua, N. Y., and
compiled a number of popular choral collections. He is the author of
<i>A Theory of Music</i> and <i>A Manual for Teachers</i>.</p>
<p>Concerning the composition of this hymn and tune, Dr. Palmer
wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This song is an inspiration. I was at work on the dry subject
of &ldquo;Theory&rdquo; when the complete idea flashed upon me, and
I laid aside the theoretical work and hurriedly penned both
words and music as fast as I could write them. I submitted
them to the criticism of a friend afterward, and some changes
were made in the third stanza, but the first two are exactly
as they came to me. The music was first written in A flat; but I
soon saw that B flat was better, and for many years it has appeared
in that key. I am reverently thankful it has been a
power for good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">YIELD NOT TO TEMPTATION.</span> The tune, composed for the
hymn by Dr. Palmer himself, appeared in <i>Sabbath School Songs</i> (1868).
It is also named &ldquo;Fortitude.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_478">478. He leadeth me, O blessed thought</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Joseph H. Gilmore</i>, 1834-1918</div>
<p>A widely used hymn, based on Psalm 23:2: &ldquo;He leadeth me beside the
still waters.&rdquo; &ldquo;It has the true hymn quality, combining all the simplicity
of spontaneous thought and feeling with perfect accent and
liquid rhythm&rdquo; (Brown and Butterworth).</p>
<p>Joseph Henry Gilmore, a Baptist minister, was born in Boston, the
son of Joseph A. Gilmore. He graduated from Brown University in
1858 and from Newton Theological Seminary in 1861. In 1863-64 he
served as private secretary to his father, then governor of New Hampshire.
From 1865 to 1867, he was pastor of the Second Baptist Church
at Rochester, N. Y., and Acting Professor of Hebrew in Rochester Theological
Seminary, 1867-68. In 1868, he became Professor of Logic,
Rhetoric, and English Literature in the University of Rochester, a position
he held for about forty years. One of his published volumes is
<i>Outlines of English and American Literature</i>, 1905.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>The hymn was written after Dr. Gilmore had conducted the Wednesday
evening service at the First Baptist Church, Philadelphia, where he
expounded the twenty-third Psalm. After the service, the discussion of
the subject was continued in the home where he was stopping. The
author says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the conversation, the blessedness of God&rsquo;s leadership
so grew upon me that I took out my pencil, wrote the hymn
just as it stands today, handed it to my wife, and thought no
more about it. She sent it, without my knowledge, to the
<i>Watchman and Reflector</i>. Three years later, I went to Rochester
to preach for the Second Baptist Church. On entering the
chapel, I took up a hymn book, thinking: &ldquo;I wonder what they
sing.&rdquo; The book opened at &ldquo;He Leadeth Me,&rdquo; and that was
the first I knew my hymn had found a place among the songs
of the Church.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">HE LEADETH ME.</span> Finding the hymn in a Christian periodical,
Bradbury composed for it this popular tune with which it has since
been associated. In singing the tune, holds should be observed at the
end of lines 2, 3, and 4 of the stanzas, and at the end of lines 2 and 4 of
the refrain. &ldquo;Few composers have so exactly caught the tone and spirit
of their text as Bradbury did when he vocalized the gliding measures
of &lsquo;He Leadeth Me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_479">479. Joys are flowing like a river</h3>
<div class="author"><i>M. P. Ferguson</i></div>
<p>A song of comfort and joy useful for the quiet hour. The presence

disciples on the stormy lake when He awoke and spoke the word of
peace (Mark 4:37-41).</p>
<p>No information has been traced concerning the author of the words,

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_480">480. Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Fanny J. Crosby</i>, 1820-1915</div>
<p>Another of Fanny Crosby&rsquo;s fine lyrics, sung the world over, in which
is revealed the secret of the author&rsquo;s own serene trust and cheerful
faith. In her <i>Memories of Eighty Years</i>, Miss Crosby makes the following
reference to this hymn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Often I take in my mind some tune already well known as a
model or, perhaps, more accurately speaking, as a guide, and
work to it. This, however, does not imply that the tune will ultimately
be chosen as the companion of the words; for it has
probably already its own true and lawful mate, with which it
<span class="pb" id="Page_277">277</span>
is to be happy and useful. Sometimes a tune is furnished me
for which to write the words. The hymn titled &ldquo;Blessed Assurance&rdquo;
was made in this manner. My dear friend, Mrs. Joseph F.
Knapp, so well-known as a writer and singer of most excellent
music and as an aid and inspiration to all who knew her, had
composed the tune; and it seemed to me one of the sweetest I
had heard for a long time. She asked me to write a hymn for it,
and I felt while bringing the words and tones together that the
air and the hymn were intended for each other. In the many
hundred times that I have heard it sung, this opinion has been
more and more confirmed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For comments on Fanny Crosby, see <a href="#hymn_313">Hymn 313</a>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ASSURANCE</span> was written by Mrs. Joseph Fairchild Knapp,
1839-1908, the daughter of Dr. Walter and Mrs. Phoebe Palmer. Her
husband was the founder of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company
in New York City. Both Mr. and Mrs. Knapp were members of the
Methodist Episcopal church and gave much of their wealth to charitable
and religious work. Mrs. Knapp, a close friend of Fanny Crosby,
was an excellent singer, an accomplished organist, and an earnest Christian
worker.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_481">481. Sweet are the promises</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Wm. A. Ogden</i>, 1841-97</div>
<p>The third stanza is based on Matt. 11:28: &ldquo;Come unto me, all ye that
labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest,&rdquo; but the author
has substituted &ldquo;weary&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;labor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wm. A. Ogden, who wrote the words and music of this song, was
born in Franklin County, Ohio. At the age of six, he moved with his
parents to Indiana where he enlisted, at the outbreak of the Civil War,
in the 13th Indiana Volunteer Infantry. After the close of the war, he
resumed his musical studies under Lowell Mason, Thomas Hastings, E.
E. Bailey, and B. F. Baker, President of the Boston School of Music. In
1870, he published <i>Silver Song</i> which reached the enormous sale of
500,000 copies. Ogden won distinction as a teacher and conductor of
large convention choruses. For six years he was director of music at
Iowa Normal School but his greatest musical work was done at Toledo,
Ohio, where he moved in 1881 and served as superintendent of public
school music from 1887 until his death. He loved children and enjoyed
teaching them. His training of 3,000 children in 1894 was the distinct
triumph of the great <i>Saengerfest</i> held that year in Toledo. Ogden wrote
scores of popular songs, always composing both the words and music.</p>

<div class="author"><i>Horatio G. Spafford</i>, 1828-88</div>
<p>A hymn of resignation and submission, written out of bitter experiences
of loss and suffering.</p>
<p>Horatio Gates Spafford, born in New York State, was a lawyer who
had established himself in Chicago. He lost most of his fortune during
the great fire in that city. Then on November 22, 1873, to add to his
trials, he lost four of his children when the French steamer, &ldquo;Villa de
Havre,&rdquo; on which Mrs. Spafford and the children were sailing for
Europe, sank in mid-ocean, half an hour after colliding with a large
sailing vessel. Mrs. Spafford was rescued and, landing at Cardiff, Wales,
ten days later, cabled her husband, &ldquo;Saved Alone.&rdquo; Spafford started
immediately for Europe to bring his wife to Chicago. D. L. Moody,
under whose preaching the Spafford children had been converted in
North Chicago shortly before sailing, travelled from Edinburgh to Liverpool
to comfort the bereaved parents and was pleased to hear them
say, &ldquo;It is well: the will of God be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Spafford later became much interested in the second
coming of Christ, becoming so enthusiastic that in 1881 they went to
Jerusalem with their remaining daughter, to witness the coming of the
Lord. After seven years in Palestine, Spafford died there, September 5,
1888, his widow continuing to live there as the head of a communistic
society with headquarters in a building outside of Jerusalem. The
daughter, very popular among the natives, became the teacher of a
large body of children, instructing them in English and in American
ways.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">IT IS WELL WITH MY SOUL.</span> The music, &ldquo;a gentle, gliding
melody that suits the mood of the words,&rdquo; was written especially for
Spafford&rsquo;s words and published in <i>Gospel Hymns No. 3</i>. The hymn and
tune immediately became popular.</p>

<p>Lydia Baxter, born in Petersburg, New York, was converted under
the preaching of a Baptist missionary, the Rev. Eben Tucker, and, with
her sister, became a leader in the organization of a Baptist Church in
her native town. After her marriage she moved to New York City.
Though an invalid for many years, she was known for her astonishing
cheerfulness and to her home came many a Christian worker for inspiration
and advice. A volume of her poems, <i>Gems by the Wayside</i>,
was published in 1855.</p>

<div class="author"><i>James H. Sammis</i>, d. 1919</div>
<p>The origin of this hymn is related in Ira Sankey&rsquo;s <i>Story of the Gospel
Hymns</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Some years ago,&rdquo; says Professor Towner, musical director
of Moody Bible Institute, &ldquo;Mr. Moody was conducting a series
of meetings in Brockton, Mass., and I had the pleasure of singing
for him there. One night a young man rose in a testimony
meeting and said, &lsquo;I am not quite sure&mdash;but I am going to trust
and obey.&rsquo; I just jotted that sentence down, and sent it with
the little story to the Rev. J. H. Sammis, a Presbyterian minister.
He wrote the hymn and the tune was born. The chorus,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Trust and obey</p>
<p class="t0">For there&rsquo;s no other way</p>
<p class="t0">To be happy in Jesus</p>
<p class="t0">But to trust and obey.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>was written before the hymn was.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>James H. Sammis was born in Brooklyn, N. Y., and became a business
man in Logansport, Indiana. As an active Christian layman, he was
much interested in the Young Men&rsquo;s Christian Association, and finally
gave up his business connections to serve as a General Secretary in the
&ldquo;Y&rdquo;. After further education at Lane and McCormick Seminaries, he
entered the ministry and served as pastor of Presbyterian churches in
Indiana, Michigan, and Minnesota. In 1909, he went to California as a
teacher in the Bible Institute of Los Angeles, continuing there until his
death, June 12, 1919.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">TRUST AND OBEY.</span> The composer of this tune, D. W. Towner,
1850-1919, was born in Rome, Pa., and became a member of a group of

singers and evangelists associated with D. L. Moody. He was a capable
leader of choirs and large assemblies. In 1893, he became director of
the musical department of Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, a position
he held until his death. In recognition of his services, the University
of Tennessee honored him with the degree of Doctor of Music, in 1900.</p>

<div class="author"><i>Edward Mote</i>, 1797-1874</div>
<p>&ldquo;A grand hymn of faith&rdquo; is the characterization given by Bishop
Bickersteth of this poem. Written in 1834, and printed as a leaflet, it
was later included in the author&rsquo;s <i>Hymns of Praise</i>, 1836, entitled, &ldquo;The
Immutable Basis of a Sinner&rsquo;s Hope.&rdquo; The hymn is reminiscent of the
words of Paul: &ldquo;Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid,
which is Jesus Christ&rdquo; (I Cor. 3:11).</p>
<p>Edward Mote, born in London, worked as a cabinet-maker for some
years but at length entered the ministry and from 1852 until his death
in 1874 served the Baptist Church at Horsham, Essex.</p>
<p>The refrain of this hymn came into his mind one morning as he

<blockquote>
<p>While I was conducting a singing-school at Hartsells, Alabama,
I received a letter from two of my former pupils in South
Carolina, conveying the sad intelligence that on the same day
each of them had buried a wife. I tried to console them by
writing a letter that might prove helpful in their hour of sadness.
Among other Scriptures, I quoted this passage, &ldquo;Underneath
are the everlasting arms.&rdquo; Before completing the writing
of the sentence, the thought came to me that the fact that we
<span class="pb" id="Page_281">281</span>
may lean on these everlasting arms and find comfort and
strength, ought to be put in a song; and before finishing that
letter, the words and music of the refrain were written. The
manuscript was sent to Elisha Hoffman ... in a few days
his completion of the poem was received.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_492">492. There is a fountain filled with blood</h3>
<div class="author"><i>William Cowper</i>, 1731-1800</div>
<p>The imagery in the first verse is drawn from Zechariah 13:1: &ldquo;In that
day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to
the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.&rdquo; The dislike
which some have for this Old Testament phraseology has given
rise to much dispute concerning the hymn, but all attempts to revise it
have been without success. It is excellent poetry and should be left as
Cowper wrote it.</p>
<p>The hymn was published in Conger&rsquo;s <i>Collection of Psalms and
Hymns</i>, 1772, and later in the <i>Olney Hymns</i> (See <a href="#hymn_60">Hymn 60</a>).</p>

camp meeting songs. It is attributed here to Lowell Mason, but it is
not certain whether he wrote it or whether it is an adaptation from
his tune, &ldquo;Cowper,&rdquo; which it resembles and to which the hymn is set
in <i>The Hymnal</i>, 1933 (Presbyterian).</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_493">493. I love to tell the story</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Katherine Hankey</i>, 1834-1911</div>
<p>A simple song which became popular and has been translated into
<span class="pb" id="Page_282">282</span>
several different languages, because it expresses what is in the hearts of
multitudes of people.</p>
<p>The words are from a long poem of 50 stanzas, in two parts, on the
life of Jesus. Part I, dated January 29, 1866, is entitled, &ldquo;The Story
Wanted.&rdquo; Part II, dated November 18, 1866, is entitled, &ldquo;The Story
Told.&rdquo; The author composed the poem during a long period of convalescing
after a serious illness. This hymn and &ldquo;Tell me the old, old
story&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_495">No. 495</a>) are selections from Part II and Part I, respectively, of
the above-mentioned poem.</p>
<p>Katherine Hankey, born in Clapham, England, was the daughter of
a banker. She was a refined, consecrated woman, a Sunday school
teacher, and organizer of Bible classes among working girls. She
travelled in South Africa to look after an invalid brother and became
so interested in mission work that she devoted thereto the income from
her writings.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">HANKEY</span> was composed for these words. For comments on
the composer, Wm. G. Fischer, see <a href="#hymn_469">Hymn 469</a>. The melody, written in
1869, was harmonized by Hubert P. Main (<a href="#hymn_426">No. 426</a>) and became popular
at revival meetings. It is one of the gospel song tunes that is included
in the more dignified church hymnals.</p>

George Stebbins introduced the song in an evangelistic campaign which
he and Dr. Pentecost were conducting in New Haven, Conn., the two
men singing the song as a duet. The song was received with enthusiasm
and immediately became popular. It was published in <i>Gospel Hymns, No. 3</i>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_497">497. Rescue the perishing</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Fanny J. Crosby</i>, 1820-1915</div>
<p>A rallying song for Christian workers in all parts of the world. This is
the only one of Fanny Crosby&rsquo;s hymns to be included in the famous
English publication, <i>Hymns Ancient and Modern</i>. It was a great
favorite of Frances E. Willard and Frances Murphy, temperance crusaders,
and D. L. Moody was very fond of it.</p>
<p>The hymn had its origin in a visit which the blind poet made to one
of the worst slum districts in New York City. When she addressed the
men at a rescue mission, Miss Crosby heard harrowing tales of lost and
perishing people. She wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;While I sat there that evening the line came to me, &lsquo;Rescue
the perishing, care for the dying.&rsquo; I could think of nothing else
that night. When I arrived at my home, I went to work at
once, and before I retired the entire hymn was ready for a
melody.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="author"><i>Charles Wesley</i>, 1707-88</div>
<p>The hymn, originally in eight stanzas, was entitled &ldquo;A Thought on
Judgment&rdquo; and was written for children! Why Wesley wrote such
serious-minded hymns for children is explained in his preface to <i>Hymns
for Children</i>, from which this hymn is taken:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are two ways of writing or speaking to children. The
one is to let ourselves down to them; the other, to lift them up
to us. Dr. Watts wrote in the former way, and has succeeded
admirably well, speaking to children as children and leaving
them as he found them. The following hymns are written on
the other plan. They contain strong and manly sense, yet expressed
in such plain and easy language as even children may
understand. But when they do understand them, they will be
children no longer&mdash;only in years and in stature.</p>

<div class="author"><i>Frank M. Davis</i>, 1839-96</div>

plied between Baltimore and Savannah.</p>
<p>Frank M. Davis was born on a farm near Marcellus, New York, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_285">285</span>
youngest of a family of ten children. He began composing tunes at
an early age and became a teacher of vocal and instrumental music.
He travelled extensively through the eastern and southern states, directing
chorus choirs and teaching vocal classes. He compiled several Sunday
school collections, among them <i>New Pearls of Song</i>, 1877, and <i>Notes
of Praise</i>, of which more than 100,000 copies were sold. Davis is the
author of over 100 vocal and instrumental compositions. He died suddenly
of heart failure at Chesterfield, Indiana, where he was attending
a camp meeting.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_503">503. My days are gliding swiftly by</h3>
<div class="author"><i>David Nelson</i>, 1793-1844</div>
<p>A hymn written by a preacher while hiding from pursuing slave-holders
whose anger and violence were aroused by Nelson&rsquo;s aggressive
anti-slavery views.</p>
<p>David Nelson, a surgeon in the U. S. Army during the war of 1812,
left his profession to become a minister, meanwhile owning and operating
a plantation in Missouri. After listening to an address on slavery,
he declared himself in favor of freeing the slaves and advocated the
plan of colonizing them in Africa. This so enraged some of the slave-holders
that they drove Nelson from his home. To avoid mob violence,
he escaped, reaching, after three days and nights of wandering, the
Mississippi River opposite Quincy, Illinois. Hiding there in the
bushes, with his pursuers near but unable to find him, the river gliding
swiftly before him, he wrote this hymn on the back of old letters he had
in his pocket. He was finally rescued by members of the Quincy Congregational
Church who, having learned of his plight, took him on a
fishing canoe and rowed him across the river, still pursued, to safety and
friends, on the hospitable shore of a free state.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">SHINING SHORE</span>, one of the composer&rsquo;s most popular tunes,
has been given various arrangements for voice and instruments. Root
has written concerning the origin of the tune:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One day, I remember, as I was working at a set of graded
part-songs for singing classes, mother passed through the room
and laid a slip from one of the religious newspapers before me,
saying, &ldquo;George, I think that would be good for music.&rdquo; I
looked at the poem which began, &ldquo;My days are gliding swiftly
by,&rdquo; and a simple melody sang itself in my mind as I read. I
jotted it down and went on with my work. That was the origin
of the music of &ldquo;The Shining Shore.&rdquo; Later, when I took up
the melody to harmonize it, it seemed so very simple and commonplace,
that I hesitated about setting the other parts to it.
I finally decided that it might be useful to somebody, and I
completed it, though it was not printed until some months
afterward. In after years I examined it in an endeavor to
<span class="pb" id="Page_286">286</span>
account for its great popularity&mdash;but in vain. To the musician
there is not one reason in melody or harmony scientifically regarded,
for such a fact. To him hundreds of others, now forgotten,
were better.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_504">504. There&rsquo;s a land that is fairer than day</h3>
<div class="author"><i>S. F. Bennett</i>, 1836-98</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be all right <i>by and by</i>.&rdquo; This trivial remark by Webster, when
one morning, seemingly depressed, he was asked by his partner, Bennett,
what was wrong with him, was the occasion for the writing of this
hymn. The author and composer were friends and partners in the
music publishing business in the village of Elkhorn, Wis. Webster, the
musician of the firm, was inclined to be nervous and subject to periods
of depression. His partner understood this and often effected a cure,
as on this occasion, by putting him to work on a new song. Upon
Bennett&rsquo;s suggestion, the two agreed that morning to make a hymn out
of the idea, &ldquo;The sweet by and by.&rdquo; Bennett penned the words and
handed them to Webster, who promptly wrote the music. Words and
music were thus produced in the incredibly short time of about thirty
minutes. The song was published soon afterward in a Sunday school
song book, <i>The Signet Ring</i>, which the two men were compiling.
From there it found its way into numerous collections of songs until
today &ldquo;it is translated into various foreign languages and sung in every
land under the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sanford Filmore Bennett was a native of the West. He settled in
Elkhorn, Wis., in 1861, to devote himself to music but later studied
medicine and practiced in Richmond, Ill.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">SWEET BY AND BY.</span> Joseph Philbrick Webster, 1819-75, composer
of this tune, was born in New Hampshire. He was an active

before finally moving to Elkhorn, in 1857.</p>

35 years, beloved of his people for his understanding and sympathy.
He had rare poetic gifts and published a number of volumes of devotional
books in which his hymns were included. His contemporary,

<p>First published in the author&rsquo;s <i>Geistliches Blumeng&auml;rtlein</i>, entitled
&ldquo;Remembrance of the glorious and delightful presence of God,&rdquo; 1729.</p>
<p>Gerhard Tersteegen, one of the greatest of German hymn writers, was
born at M&ouml;rs in Westphalia, the son of a tradesman. He was educated
at the grammar school of his native place, and then bound as an apprentice
to an elder brother, a shop-keeper at M&uuml;lheim. When his time was
out, he left his brother and moved to a little cottage near M&uuml;lheim
where for some years he supported himself by weaving silk ribbons, giving
his money to the poor, and living a life so simple that it brought upon
him the contempt of his thriving and money-getting relatives. For a
time, due to various disappointments, he lived in a &ldquo;state of darkness,&rdquo; a
five year period of spiritual depression, during which he doubted the
love, if not the existence, of God. He at last, as in a moment, regained
peace and joy, whereupon he signed, with his own blood, a covenant
with God to devote himself to His service. Soon he was found speaking
at prayer meetings and other places and became popular as a religious
teacher and counsellor. From far and wide people came to him for
personal interviews, and his public meetings were always crowded.</p>
<p>Tersteegen was never ordained. Grieved by the open sin of the
church people of his time, he early dissociated himself from the organized
church and absented himself from the communion service. Though
he had a wide following, he never organized a sect of his own, and, after
his death, most of his disciples reunited with the Reformed Church.
Like all great leaders, he pled the cause of the underprivileged. He
was a mystic of the purest type, yet his faith was practical. He provided
food and simple medicines for the poor and became widely known as
the physician to the poor and forsaken. Tersteegen had many friends
among the Mennonites and often preached in their church at Krefeld.</p>
<p>He is the author of 111 hymns, many of which have been rendered into
English.</p>
<p>Frederick Foster and John Miller, translators of stanzas one and
two, respectively, were both members of the Moravian Church. William
Mercer, translator of stanza three, was an English scholar who translated
and paraphrased many of the Latin and German hymns into
English, but is best known for his successful work as editor of <i>The
Church Psalter and Hymn Book</i>, 1857, the most popular hymn book of
the Church of England. Another translation of this hymn appears at
<a href="#hymn_508">No. 508</a>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ARNSBERG</span>, also called &ldquo;Wunderbarer K&ouml;nig,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gott ist
gegenw&auml;rtig,&rdquo; was composed by the poet and musician, Joachim Neander,
1650-80. It appeared in his collection, <i>Glaub- und Liebes&uuml;bung</i>,

the age of 21 he became totally blind, but carried on, despite the handicap,
a magnificent life work as president of the schools at Colmar. He
was also the founder of a nursery for Protestant children.</p>
<p>Christian George Haas, translator of the hymn, was a minister in the
Evangelical Church. After graduating from Eden Theological Seminary,
he held pastorates in St. Paul and in Buffalo, and edited the <i>Hymnal of
the Evangelical Church</i>, 1898.</p>

<p>A popular hymn of praise and thanksgiving, written in 1704, shortly
after the author&rsquo;s home was destroyed by fire! Our version is a selection
of stanzas 1, 4, 5, and 15, of the original 15.</p>
<p>The author, Johann Mentzer, was for 38 years a pastor at Kemnitz,
Saxony, and belonged to the more conservative Pietistic school of hymn
writers. He is the author of 34 hymns, many of them of high merit.</p>

Balthasar K&ouml;nig, 1691-1758, director of music in several churches in

Frankfurt, 1738, where it is set to the hymn, &ldquo;Ach sagt mir nichts von
Gold und Sch&auml;tzen.&rdquo; The <i>Harmonischer Liederschatz</i>, edited by K&ouml;nig,

<div class="author"><i>Francis Scott Key</i>, 1779-1843</div>
<p>The author of this hymn, Francis Scott Key, is known to every American
child as the man who wrote our national anthem, &ldquo;The Star
Spangled Banner.&rdquo; Born in Frederick County, Virginia, he was educated
at St. John&rsquo;s College, Annapolis. He practiced law in Washington,
D. C., and served as United States District Attorney for three
terms, till his death on January 11, 1843. As a member of the Protestant
Episcopal Church, he held a lay reader&rsquo;s license and for many
years read the service and visited the sick. He taught a Bible class and
conducted family prayers twice a day, requiring all members of the
household, including the servants, to be present. He did much for the
negroes of the south and although he lived in a slave state, he was
moved by conscientious scruples to free his own slaves. The hymn, as
he wrote it, had four stanzas. The second and third stanzas, omitted
here, read as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Praise, my soul, the God that sought thee,</p>
<p class="t">Wretched wanderer, far astray;</p>
<p class="t0">Found thee lost, and kindly brought thee</p>
<p class="t">From the paths of death away;</p>
<p class="t0">Praise, with love&rsquo;s devoutest feeling,</p>
<p class="t">Him who saw thy guilt-born fear,</p>
<p class="t0">And, the light of hope revealing,</p>
<p class="t">Bade the blood-stained cross appear.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Praise thy Saviour God that drew thee</p>
<p class="t">To that cross, new life to give,</p>
<p class="t0">Held a blood-sealed pardon to thee,</p>
<p class="t">Bade thee look to Him and live.</p>
<p class="t0">Praise the grace whose threats alarmed thee,</p>
<p class="t">Roused thee from thy fatal ease,</p>
<p class="t0">Praise the grace whose promise warmed thee,</p>
<p class="t">Praise the grace that whispered peace.</p>

<p>The hymn is based on Deut. 32:3: &ldquo;Because I will publish the name
of the Lord: ascribe ye greatness unto our God.&rdquo; The original poem of
nine stanzas, Sch&uuml;tz&rsquo;s only hymn, first appeared in his <i>Christliches Gedenkb&uuml;chlein</i>.
Our hymn is a translation of stanzas 1, 3, 5, and 7 of
the original.</p>
<p>The author, Johann Jakob Sch&uuml;tz, born at Frankfurt-am-Main, was
a lawyer by profession. He was a man of deep religious convictions and
a close friend of P. J. Spener and Joachim Neander, early leaders of
the Pietist movement in Germany. Sch&uuml;tz left the Lutheran church and
became a separatist. He died at Frankfurt-am-Main.</p>
<p>The translation is by Frances Cox, 1812-97, an English woman of culture
and learning who is second only to Catherine Winkworth as a
translator of German hymns.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">MIT FREUDEN ZART</span>, one of our finest hymn tunes, was used
by the Bohemian Brethren, and is probably much older than their
<i>Gesangbuch</i> of 1566 in which it first appeared. The tune is a joyous
one, as the name indicates, and should not be sung too slowly. All the
voices are to sing the melody, the accompanying instrument bringing
out the harmonization.</p>

<p>The hymn is a poetic version of Psalm 146. It was first published in
the second part of Freylinghausen&rsquo;s <i>Gesangbuch</i>, Halle, 1714, the original
having 8 stanzas. The translation here given is a free rendering of
stanzas 1 and 8, and was made especially for the <i>Hymnary</i>.</p>
<p>The author of this hymn, Johann Daniel Herrnschmidt, a learned
and devout man, was born in Bopfingen, in W&uuml;rttemberg, where his
father was pastor. He was a pupil and for a time assistant of pastor
August Francke in Halle. Later he became minister in Bopfingen, then
superintendent and councilman at Nassau-Idstein. In 1715 he became
teacher and pastor in Halle where he died 8 years later.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">LOBE DEN HERREN, O MEINE SEELE</span>, inseparably united with
this hymn, is one of the most brilliant and striking gems in our chorale
treasury. The composer is unknown. The tune first appeared in <i>Anhang

<i>Gesangbuch</i>, 1714.</p>

<p>The <i>Te Deum</i> of Germany. It is the most celebrated hymn coming
out of the second period (1570-1648) of German hymnody.</p>
<p>The first two stanzas of the hymn were composed as a <i>Tischlied</i>, a
grace after meat, to be sung by the author&rsquo;s household. The third stanza
was added as a doxology. The hymn was sung at the conclusion of the
Peace of Westphalia which ended the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, and has been
used since on many national occasions of thanksgiving, not only in Germany
but in England and America as well.</p>
<p>Martin Rinkart was born in Eilenburg, Saxony, the son of a cooper.
After graduating from the University of Leipzig, he held appointments
as Master at the Gymnasium and Cantor of St. Nicholas Church in
Eisleben, then became, in 1617, Archidiaconus at Eilenburg, a position
he held the rest of his life. Rinkart was poet, dramatist, and musician,
as well as pastor. During the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, his church at Eilenburg
became an asylum for refugees from all parts. The suffering from
famine and pestilence was indescribable. For some time, Rinkart was
the only clergyman in the town, and he frequently conducted as many
as forty funeral services in one day. A man of sympathy and generosity,
he strained his own resources in his efforts to keep others from starving.</p>
<p>The translation is from Miss Winkworth&rsquo;s <i>Lyra Germanica</i>, 1858.</p>

<p>The hymn is based on Psalm 103:1-6 and Psalm 150. It is &ldquo;a magnificent
song of praise, probably the finest there is, when we consider the
tune, and certainly the finest production of Neander&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neander was the first prominent writer of hymns in the Reformed
Church of Germany which for a long time used only metrical versions
of the Psalms in public worship. After a brief and stormy ministry, he
died at the age of thirty.</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">LOBE DEN HERREN</span> is a tune of great vigor and strength, yet
simple of structure. It is very usable in a service of praise and thanksgiving
and has been sung with great effect by large chorus choirs. The
origin of the tune is uncertain. It appeared anonymously in <i>Ander Theil
des Erneuerten Gesangbuch</i>, Stralsund, 1665, to the words, &ldquo;Hast du
denn, Liebster, dein Angesicht g&auml;nzlich verborgen,&rdquo; by Ahasuerus
Fritsch, which suggests a secular origin of the melody. It is believed, by
<span class="pb" id="Page_300">300</span>
some authorities, that Neander himself adapted it from an earlier
chorale. The tune appears with many variants of melody and harmonization
in different hymn books. The present form has been used since
1708.</p>

<p>The hymn was first published in Leipzig, 1757, in six stanzas, entitled,
&ldquo;The Goodness of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gellert was one of the most popular writers in German literature.
Born in Saxony, the son of a Lutheran country preacher, he attended
F&uuml;rstenschule at Meissen, and then went to the University of Leipzig
where he studied philosophy and theology. Later he lectured at that
university on poetry, elocution, and moral philosophy. He was beloved
by all his classes, the lectures sometimes being attended by four hundred.
Outside the university he was even more popular. A poor peasant
once unloaded a cart full of wood before Gellert&rsquo;s house, begging him
to accept the gift as thanks for his beautiful fables. The keynote of his
popularity is expressed in one of his letters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mein gr&ouml;sster Ehrgeiz besteht darin, dasz ich den Vern&uuml;nftigen
dienen und gefallen will, und nicht den Gelehrten im
engen Verstande. Ein kluges Frauenzimmer gilt mir mehr als
eine gelehrte Zeitung, und der niedrigste Mann von gesundem
Verstande ist mir w&uuml;rdig genug, seine Aufmerksamkeit zu suchen,
sein Vergn&uuml;gen zu bef&ouml;rdern und ihm in einem leicht zu
behaltenden Ausdrucke gute Wahrheiten zu sagen und edle
Empfindungen in seiner Seele rege zu machen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gellert&rsquo;s reputation rests chiefly on his fables and stories. His best religious
poems are &ldquo;Wie gross ist des Allm&auml;cht&rsquo;gen G&uuml;te,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dies ist der
Tag, den Gott gemacht,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jesus lebt, mit ihm auch ich&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_543">543</a>).</p>
<p>No information is at hand concerning the translator, Margarete M&uuml;nsterberg.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">WIE GROSS IST DES ALLM&Auml;CHT&rsquo;GEN G&Uuml;TE</span> is ascribed here to C.
F. Richter. The Canadian <i>Gesangbuch</i> credits the tune to J. Freylinghausen.</p>
<p>Christian Friedrich Richter, 1676-1711, born at Sorau, in Niederlausitz,
studied medicine and theology in Halle and became practicing
physician in the Orphanage in Halle. A deeply religious man with
poetic insight, he wrote 33 hymns, and is the author of a treatise on the
Crucifixion of Christ.</p>

<p>One of the great hymns by the German mystic, Gerhard Tersteegen.</p>
<p>For comments on Tersteegen see <a href="#hymn_506">Hymn 506</a>.</p>
<p>Our version is a free translation of stanzas 1, 2, and 4 of the original 8.</p>
<p>Herman Brueckner, translator of the hymn, was born in Eisenach,
Germany, and was educated at the Universities of Leipzig, Greifswald,
and Jena. The latter gave him the doctor&rsquo;s degree in theology in 1923.
Coming to America, Brueckner served a year as Lutheran Seaman&rsquo;s
Pastor for the Port of New York. From 1915 to 1931 he was pastor of St.
Matthaeus Lutheran Church, Hoboken, N. J., and since that time has
served as Professor of Church History in Hartwick Seminary. He is the
<span class="pb" id="Page_303">303</span>
author of a number of volumes on ecclesiastical and historical subjects,
among them, <i>Church and State in Germany</i>, published in 1934.</p>
<p>Brueckner&rsquo;s translation was slightly altered by the editors of the
<i>Hymnary</i>, at two points:</p>
<p>Stanza 1, line 4: &ldquo;And sign of thy celestial lore,&rdquo; to &ldquo;Thy name to
honor and adore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stanza 2, line 5: &ldquo;Thy love, so tender, and caressing,&rdquo; to &ldquo;Thy love,
so tender, so possessing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ST. PETERSBURG</span>, also known as &ldquo;Wells,&rdquo; &ldquo;Wellspring,&rdquo; and

<p>A hymn in praise of God, the Creator of heaven and earth, originally
in 10 stanzas. It is based on Psalm 104, one of the great nature Psalms.</p>
<p>Johann Andreas Cramer was the son of a Lutheran pastor. He was
educated at Leipzig and became famous as a preacher and teacher, later
serving as Professor of Theology and Chancellor of the University of
Kiel in Germany. He wrote numerous religious lyrics and psalm versions,
a number of which passed into the hymnbooks of his time, and
several of which have been translated into English.</p>
<p>The present hymn is a translation of stanzas 1 and 10 of the German
original. No information has been traced concerning Harriett R.
Spaeth, the translator.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">HERR, DIR IST NIEMAND VERGLEICHEN</span> derives its name from
the first line of the hymn with which it is associated. The composer,
Justin Heinrich Knecht, 1752-1817, was an eminent German organist
and music director of the town of Biberach, Swabia. He edited the
<i>W&uuml;rttemberg Choralbuch</i>, an important collection of tunes, to which
he contributed 97 of his own compositions.</p>

<p>The words are a rhymed form of the <i>Te Deum</i> which Luther, in
strict ecclesiastical style, translated from the Latin. The hymn is popular
among Roman Catholics, Lutherans, and Anglicans, as a post-communion
hymn, and is a great favorite among Mennonite churches.
It sounds a universal note of praise that can be sung by Christians of all
denominations. The hymn was used at the opening of the first World
Assembly of Churches, held at Amsterdam, August 22 to September 4,
1948, where it was sung simultaneously in different tongues.</p>
<p>The author, Ignaz Franz, was born at Protzan, Kr. Frankenstein, in
Silesia. He first was priest in Schlowa, and then became rector of a
graduate school for priests in Breslau. In 1772, under the influence of
the Enlightenment, he published a Catholic hymnbook. He is described
as a man filled with zeal for the good things in religion and
the church.</p>
<p>Note: The <i>Te Deum</i> is a long Latin hymn of uncertain origin, constituting
the supreme expression of rejoicing in the Roman Catholic,
Anglican, and other Christian Churches. It is sometimes called the
&ldquo;Canticle of Ambrose and Augustine,&rdquo; from the legend that at the
baptism of Augustine by Ambrose it was sung antiphonally, extempore,
by the two men. It dates back to the fourth or fifth century. Its contents
are drawn from different sources: the Apostles&rsquo; Creed, the &ldquo;Gloria
in Excelsis,&rdquo; and the Psalms (e.g. 28:9, 31:1, 33:22, 123:3, 145:2). Luther,
who translated it into German, praised it as a &ldquo;fine symbol or
<span class="pb" id="Page_306">306</span>
confession, not only for confessing the right faith but also for praising
and thanking God withal.&rdquo; A real confession of faith ought to be
sung, and as such the <i>Te Deum</i> has been on the lips of the Church, in
one form or another, ever since it was composed.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">GROSSER GOTT, WIR LOBEN DICH</span> is of unknown composition.
The tune first appeared in the <i>Katholisches Gesangbuch</i>, a book undated
but not earlier than 1774, set to the words, &ldquo;Grosser Gott.&rdquo; Its
first appearance in a Protestant hymn book was in Schicht&rsquo;s <i>Choral-Buch</i>,
Leipzig, 1819. It was set to English words in <i>Melodia Sacra</i>,
Dublin, 1844, to the hymn, &ldquo;Jesus, and shall it ever be,&rdquo; where the
tune was modified to fit the words and named, &ldquo;Stillorgan.&rdquo; Later, under
the name, &ldquo;Hursley&rdquo;, it became widely associated with Keble&rsquo;s evening
hymn, &ldquo;Sun of my Soul&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_30">No. 30</a>). <i>St. Basil&rsquo;s Hymnal</i> (Roman
Catholic, 1918), as well as the <i>Gesangbuch mit Noten</i>, attribute the
tune to Peter Ritter; <i>Glaubensharfe</i>, to J. Haydn. There seems to be
no good evidence for either. The English <i>Church Hymnary</i>, London,
1935, has set the tune, naming it &ldquo;Pascal&rdquo;, to Toplady&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rock of Ages.&rdquo;
In some of the books the last score is marked with a repeat sign for the
sake of emphasis and climax.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_520">520. Holy Lord, holy Lord</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Anonymous</i></div>
<p>The notes of thanksgiving and praise are dominant. The origin
of the hymn has not been traced.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">FAHRE FORT</span>, attributed erroneously in the <i>Hymnary</i> to
Johann E. Schmidt, is of anonymous origin. It appeared in Freylinghausen&rsquo;s
<i>Gesangbuch</i>, Halle, 1704, with the well-known hymn, &ldquo;Fahre
fort, fahre fort,&rdquo; by Johann E. Schmidt, 1669-1745. The tune derived its
name from this hymn.</p>

<p>An example of what a good, popular hymn should be&mdash;&ldquo;neither didactic
nor introspective, but natural, strong, and churchly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The author, Nikolaus Decius, was a contemporary of Luther. (The
date, &ldquo;1626,&rdquo; in the <i>Hymnary</i> is obviously wrong.) He was a monk in
the Roman Catholic Church but became a follower of Luther, leaving
the cloister at Steterburg, in 1519, to become a teacher and evangelical
preacher. His work was carried on under constant opposition from
the Church of Rome. He died suddenly in 1541 with some suspicion
of having been poisoned by his enemies. Three hymns are ascribed to
Decius: versions of the <i>Sanctus</i>, the <i>Gloria in excelsis</i>, and the <i>Agnus
Dei</i> (<a href="#hymn_540">No. 540</a>). The present hymn is a translation of the second, the
<i>Gloria in excelsis</i>. It became very popular, though Luther did not use
it in any of his collections.</p>
<p>For comments on Catherine Winkworth see <a href="#hymn_236">Hymn 236</a>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">NUN FREUT EUCH</span> is also attributed to Decius who was a good
musician as well as a popular preacher. It is often called &ldquo;Luther&rsquo;s
Hymn&rdquo; but there is no evidence that he wrote it. The tune appeared
in <i>Geistliche Lieder</i>, Wittenberg, 1535, where it was set to Luther&rsquo;s
hymn, &ldquo;Nun freut euch, liebe Christengemein.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This hymn, with its magnificent tune, has long been known as the
&ldquo;King of Chorals.&rdquo; (For the &ldquo;Queen of Chorals&rdquo; see <a href="#hymn_529">No. 529</a>). Percy
Dearmer writes of this choral: &ldquo;There is no other hymn like this, surely
the grandest and most thrilling, both in words and music&mdash;and both
words and music by the same man.&rdquo; It is based on the parable of
the wise and foolish virgins in Matt. 25:1-13, and on Rev. 19:6-9
(the marriage of the Lamb); 21:22; 1 Cor. 2:9; Ezek. 3:17; and Isa.
52:8.</p>
<p>Nicolai, an ardent Lutheran and influential preacher, was fierce in
his denunciation of both Calvinism and Roman Catholicism. He held
pastorates in various places. From 1601 until his death, he was chief
pastor of St. Katherine&rsquo;s, Hamburg. It was during his five years at Unna,
Westphalia, that a terrible pestilence swept through the community,
claiming the lives of over 1300 people. Nicolai&rsquo;s parsonage overlooked
the church yard where the burial of the victims was taking
place continually. These scenes of sorrow and death moved him to
write this great judgment hymn which he entitled, &ldquo;Of the Voice at Midnight,
and the Wise Virgins who meet their Heavenly Bridegroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For comments on Miss Winkworth, translator, see <a href="#hymn_236">Hymn 236</a>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">WACHET AUF</span>, one of the greatest and most solemn melodies
of evangelical Christendom, was composed by Nicolai. The present
setting is by Michael Praetorius, 1571-1621, a writer on the theory of
music and a composer of note. The melody was used by Bach in one
of his cantatas and Mendelssohn used it in his <i>St. Paul</i>. Handel
used the seventh and eighth lines of the melody with great effect in
the &ldquo;Hallelujah Chorus,&rdquo; with the phrase, &ldquo;The kingdom of this
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of our finest German Advent hymns, based on Psalm 24. It was
written for use on the first Sunday in Advent.</p>
<p>Georg Weissel was born at Domnau, Prussia. He was a student of
theology, a teacher, and, from 1623, until his death in 1635, the pastor
of Roszg&auml;rt&rsquo;schen Church in K&ouml;nigsberg. He is the author of twenty
hymns, this being probably the best and most widely used. Our version
is a translation of stanzas 1, 2, 3, and 5 of the original.</p>
<p>For comments on Catherine Winkworth see <a href="#hymn_236">Hymn 236</a>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">MACHT HOCH DIE T&Uuml;R</span> is one of several chorale tunes, probably
the most popular, to which this hymn is set.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_310">310</div>
<p>The composer, Johann Freylinghausen, 1670-1739, was born at Gandersheim,
the son of the town&rsquo;s burgomaster. He was educated at Jena.
After the death of his father-in-law, August Francke, Pietist leader, he
became the latter&rsquo;s successor as director of the Paedagogium and the
Orphanage in Halle and pastor in full charge of St. Ulrich&rsquo;s. Freylinghausen
was a musician and wrote some 22 church melodies but his
outstanding work consists of his two collections of hymns: <i>Geistreiches

<p>Phillipp Friedrich Hiller, son of a Lutheran Pastor, was born at M&uuml;hlhausen,
W&uuml;rttemberg. To escape the French invaders, he fled with his
parents, at the age of 8, to Heidenheim. In 1713, he went to the Klosterschule,
Denkendorf, where Bengel had a decided influence upon him.
In 1748, he became the pastor in Steinheim, where, after three years
of faithful service, a throat disease afflicted him, resulting in the loss
of his voice. No longer able to preach, he gave himself to Bible study
<span class="pb" id="Page_311">311</span>
and writing, composing more than 100 hymns, and publishing a volume
of religious poetry, <i>Geistliches Liederk&auml;stlein</i>.</p>
<p>The translation is by Joseph Augustus Seiss, a Lutheran minister,
born at Graceham, Md., and educated at Gettysburg College and
Seminary. Seiss was a noted pulpit orator in his denomination and
held pastorates in Virginia, Maryland, and, finally, in Philadelphia.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">GASTORIUS</span> is ascribed by some authorities to Johann Pachelbel
of N&uuml;rnberg, a contemporary of Gastorius. The melody appeared
in the <i>Auserlesenes Weimarisches Gesangbuch</i>, 1681. Zahn, on the basis
of careful study of the sources, does not hesitate to credit its composition
to Gastorius, about 1675. It was originally set to a hymn by Samuel
Rodigast, &ldquo;Was Gott tut, das ist wohlgetan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Severus Gastorius, cantor in Jena, was born about 1650. Details concerning
his life are not available.</p>

<p>Paul Gerhardt&rsquo;s beautiful Christmas poem, in 15 stanzas, appeared
in Johann Cr&uuml;ger&rsquo;s <i>Praxis Pietatis Melica</i>, Berlin, 1653, together with
a tune composed for it by Cr&uuml;ger. The present hymn is a selection of
stanzas 1, 7 and 8, from Catherine Winkworth&rsquo;s translation. The original
15 stanzas are printed here in full for the benefit of those who may
wish to read the whole hymn and study its structure.</p>

another of Gerhardt&rsquo;s hymns, &ldquo;Warum sollt ich mich denn gr&auml;men,&rdquo;
from whence the tune derives its name. The composer, Johann Georg
Ebeling, 1620-76, was cantor of St. Nicholas Cathedral, Berlin, and director
of music at the Grayfriars Gymnasium there, succeeding Johann
Cr&uuml;ger to these positions, in 1662. Six years later, he became Professor
of Music at the Carolinen Gymnasium, Stettin.</p>

<div class="author"><i>St. Germanus</i>, 634-734</div>
<div class="author"><i>Tr. John M. Neale</i>, 1818-66</div>
<p>This is one of a half dozen or more hymns in our book that have
come down from the ancient Eastern or Greek Church. (Other hymns
from this period are Nos. <a href="#hymn_34">34</a>, <a href="#hymn_113">113</a>, <a href="#hymn_115">115</a>, <a href="#hymn_143">143</a>, and <a href="#hymn_398">398</a>.)</p>
<p>St. Germanus was born and died in Constantinople. He lived to be
a hundred years old. He became an influential leader in the church,
and served, for a time, as Patriarch, or Bishop of Constantinople.</p>
<p>For this translation, we are indebted to John M. Neale, English
hymnologist and classical scholar. Neale possessed extraordinary linguistic
skill and did more than anyone else to make available to English
speaking people some of the rich treasure of Greek and Latin hymnody.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ES IST EIN&rsquo; ROS&rsquo; ENTSPRUNGEN</span>, also known as &ldquo;Rosa Mystica,&rdquo;

<p>This children&rsquo;s Christmas carol, based on the second chapter of Luke,
was written by Martin Luther for his little son Hans for the Christmas
celebration in his own home, 1534. Luther&rsquo;s instructions were that the
first seven verses were to be sung by a man dressed as an angel, whereupon
the children would greet him with the singing of verses eight to
fifteen. The present hymn is a selection of stanzas 1, 2, 3, 8, 13, and 15.</p>

<div class="author"><i>H. Downton</i>, 1818-85</div>
<p>Originally in seven stanzas, this hymn was first published, 1843, in
the <i>Church of England Magazine</i>, under the title, &ldquo;A Hymn for the
Commencement of the Year.&rdquo; It is a first-rate quality hymn for the
New Year.</p>
<p>The author, Henry Downton, was born in Pulverbatch, Shropshire,
England. In 1840, he graduated from Cambridge where his father was
sub-librarian of Trinity College. After serving as curate of St. John&rsquo;s
Chatham, Downton became English chaplain at Geneva in 1857, returning
to England in 1873 to become rector of Hopton, Suffolk. In
Geneva, he had become acquainted with the hymnody of the Swiss and
French Churches, and translated a number of their hymns into English.
He published <i>Hymns and Verses, Original and Translated</i>,
1873.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">CULBACH</span> appeared in <i>Heilige Seelenlust</i>, Breslau, 1657, set
to the hymn, &ldquo;Ach wann kommt die Zeit heran.&rdquo; The melody, simple
in structure and well within the pitch range of all voices, is admirably
adapted to congregational singing, in unison or in parts. The composer

<p>Known as the &ldquo;Queen of the Chorales.&rdquo; The words and music were
written in 1527 by the Lutheran pastor, Philipp Nicolai, during the
same pestilence that inspired &ldquo;Wachet auf,&rdquo; the &ldquo;King of Chorales&rdquo;
(<a href="#hymn_522">No. 522</a>). Nicolai, in deep meditation concerning the suffering around
him, started writing the hymn one morning, and forgetting his noonday
meal, worked on till he had finished it in the late afternoon. It
was first published in the author&rsquo;s <i>Freuden-Spiegel</i>, Frankfurt, 1599, under
the title, &ldquo;A Spiritual bridal song of the believing soul, concerning
<span class="pb" id="Page_317">317</span>
her Heavenly Bridegroom, founded in the 45th Psalm of the prophet
David.&rdquo; Catherine Winkworth wrote of the chorale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So popular did it soon become, that its tune was often
chimed by city chimes, lines and verses from it were printed
by way of ornament on the common earthenware of the country,
and it was invariably used at weddings and certain festivals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">NICOLAI</span> is usually known by the first line of the words
for which it was written, &ldquo;Wie sh&ouml;n leuchtet der Morgenstern.&rdquo; It
is a magnificent chorale tune. Mendelssohn used the tune in his
<i>Christus</i>, and Bach made a harmonization of it.</p>

<p>A metrical version of Psalm 130. It is considered by many to be
Luther&rsquo;s best production and Julian ranks it with the finest German
psalm versions. The hymn was first published in Luther&rsquo;s <i>Etlich
Cristlich Lider</i>, Wittenberg, 1524, and in his <i>Eyn Enchiridion</i>, Erfurt,
1524, in four stanzas. It was then rewritten and expanded into five
stanzas and in this form published in Johann Walther&rsquo;s <i>Geystliche
Gesangk Buchleyn</i>, Wittenberg, 1524, and again in Luther&rsquo;s later work,
<i>Christliche Geseng zum Begrebnis</i>, Wittenberg, 1542. It is appropriate
for use at a Christian burial, as well as other occasions, and was sung
at Halle, in 1546, while Luther&rsquo;s body was being brought from Eisleben
to Wittenberg for burial.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;depths&rdquo; from which the psalmist cries to God for deliverance,
are not so much physical and psychical as moral and spiritual. The
writer is conscious of his sinfulness, as well as the sinfulness of his
people and sees that there is no help except through penitence and
acceptance of the mercy and forgiveness of God.</p>
<p>The first three stanzas from Catherine Winkworth&rsquo;s translation were
selected for use here.</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">AUS TIEFER NOT</span>, also called &ldquo;De Profundis,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Luther&rsquo;s
130th,&rdquo; is attributed to Luther himself. J. S. Bach&rsquo;s cantata, <i>Aus tiefer
Not schrei&rsquo; ich zu Dir</i>, is built on this tune. Luther believed in the
power of music to drive away the Evil One and frequently, when
anxious about the fate of his cause, he would say to his companions,
&ldquo;Come, let us confound the devil and all his followers, by singing
together the psalm, &lsquo;Aus tiefer Not.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Based on 1 Peter 3:18: &ldquo;For Christ also hath once suffered for sins,
the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert Bridges included this hymn in his <i>Yattendon Hymnal</i>, 1899,
London, and later it became known to a wider public by its appearance
in the <i>English Hymnal</i>, 1906, and in <i>Songs of Praise</i>, 1933.</p>
<p>Johann Heermann, a distinguished scholar and one of the greatest
of German hymn writers, was a Lutheran minister and pastor, in Silesia.
On account of ill health, he retired and devoted himself to literary work.
This hymn, written during the miseries of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, was
composed for Passiontide and was entitled, &ldquo;The Cause of the Bitter
Sufferings of Jesus Christ and Consolations from His Love and Grace.&rdquo;
The author experienced much suffering himself. First came the death of
his wife in 1617, then the failure of his own health, and then the war.
His hymns are characterized by tenderness and depth of feeling, and
illustrate the truth that real poets &ldquo;learn in suffering what they teach
in song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For comments on the translator, Robert Bridges, see <a href="#hymn_32">Hymn 32</a>. His
first two stanzas are translations of 1 and 2 of the original; while stanzas
3 and 4 contain suggestions, only, of 6 and 7 and the rest of Heermann&rsquo;s
poem.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">HERZLIEBSTER JESU</span> is a grandly impressive tune, composed
by the distinguished musician and writer of chorales, Johann Cr&uuml;ger,
1598-1662. It has been observed that nearly five-sevenths of this whole
melody has a downward movement, which accounts for some of its intensely
solemn character. J. S. Bach used the tune in his <i>St. Matthew&rsquo;s
Passion</i>.</p>

and of his wife, and other difficulties, bore heavily upon him and he
was led, as a result, to turn to God and place all his confidence in Him.
In the preface to one of his hymn collections, he wrote: &ldquo;I was especially
induced and compelled to their composition by the anxious and
sore domestic afflictions by which God ... has for some time laid me
aside.&rdquo; He is the author of 148 hymns.</p>

<p>The hymn is based on Mark 15:29, 30: &ldquo;And they that passed by
railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest
the temple, and buildest it in three days, Save thyself, and come down
from the cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Savonarola of Florence, one of the greatest of medieval preachers
and reformers in the Catholic Church, was destined by his parents to
enter the medical profession, but after a careful study of the Scriptures
<span class="pb" id="Page_324">324</span>
and the writings of Thomas Aquinas, he decided to enter a Dominican
monastery. Here he spent many years in further study and thinking out
his preaching message. Living in a time when the moral tone of Christianity
was at a very low ebb, Savonarola preached boldly and eloquently
against the sins of a corrupt world and a corrupt church. His
relentless denunciation of the pope and priests resulted in his excommunication
by Pope Alexander VI, and on May 23, 1498, he was publicly
executed on one of the streets of Florence. His death as a martyr
proved to Luther, across the Alps, that it is &ldquo;hopeless to hope in the
purification of Rome,&rdquo; and gave to the reformation movement a powerful
impulse.</p>
<p>The translation of the hymn is by Jane Elgee, daughter of Archdeacon
Elgee, of Ireland. In 1851 she married Sir William Wilde, an
oculist living in Dublin.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">O DU LIEBE MEINER LIEBE</span> comes from Johann Thommen&rsquo;s

<p>A heart-searching passion hymn, from the pen of Christian Renatus,
Graf von Zinzendorf, second son of the renowned Nikolaus Ludwig,
Graf von Zinzendorf, founder of the Moravian Br&uuml;dergemeinde at
Herrnhut. (See <a href="#hymn_574">Hymn 574</a>.) Born at Herrnhut, and educated by his
parents, he became his father&rsquo;s assistant in 1744, continuing until 1749.
Illness overtook him and he spent the last years of his life, an invalid,
in London where he died at the age of 25. Zinzendorf was a young man
of maturity and deep Christian convictions, and composed a number
of hymns. The present hymn, probably his best production, was first
published in the appendix of the <i>London Hymn Book</i>, 1755.</p>
<p>The translation is by J. C. Hansen, formerly Professor of Classical
Languages at Eden Seminary and now of Elmhurst College, Elmhurst,

<p>A profound hymn coming originally out of the golden age of Latin
hymnody. <i>Salve caput cruentatum</i> is the last of a series of seven poems
on the crucified Savior, each poem addressing itself to a separate member
of Christ&rsquo;s body&mdash;feet, knees, hands, side, breast, heart, and head.
The work is attributed to Bernard of Clairvaux, preacher of the Second
Crusade, and one of the most brilliant of Latin hymn writers. Luther
wrote of him: &ldquo;If there has ever been a pious monk who feared God it
was St. Bernard, whom alone I hold in much higher esteem than all
other monks and priests throughout the globe.&rdquo; Bernard founded a
monastery in Wormwood, a robber-infested valley in France. He
changed the name to &ldquo;Clara Vallis,&rdquo; (Beautiful Valley), from which is
derived the designation &ldquo;Clairvaux.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though composed in the twelfth century, the hymn did not achieve
fame until five centuries later when it was translated into German by
Paul Gerhardt, who, next to Luther, was the greatest of all German
hymn writers. His translation, a free paraphrase, appeared in Cr&uuml;ger&rsquo;s
<i>Praxis</i>, 1656, and is considered by Philip Schaff to be &ldquo;fully equal to the
original.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For comment on Gerhardt see <a href="#hymn_134">Hymn 134</a>.</p>
<p>The translation into English was made in 1849 by James W. Alexander
of Princeton, a Presbyterian. Schaff wrote that &ldquo;Dr. Alexander is
beyond doubt one of the best translators of German hymns into idiomatic
English.&rdquo; He also wrote concerning this hymn that it has &ldquo;shown
an imperishable vitality in passing from the Latin into the German and
from the German into the English, and proclaiming in three tongues
and in the name of three confessions&mdash;the Catholic, the Lutheran, and
the Reformed&mdash;with equal effect, the dying love of our Savior, and our
boundless indebtedness to Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our hymn is a selection of stanzas 1, 4, 8, and 10. In the first stanza,
the line, &ldquo;I marvel at the story,&rdquo; is substituted for Alexander&rsquo;s original
which read, &ldquo;Yet though despised and gory.&rdquo; Stanza 10 has been frequently
used as a prayer for the dying.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">PASSION CHORALE</span> was originally set to a love song entitled,
&ldquo;Mein G&rsquo;m&uuml;t ist mir verwirret.&rdquo; The tune was composed by the distinguished
organist, Hans Leo Hassler, and first appeared in his
<span class="pb" id="Page_328">328</span>
<i>Lustgarten Neuer Teutscher Ges&auml;ng</i>, 1601. In 1613 it appeared in <i>Harmoni&aelig;
Sacr&aelig;</i>, set to the hymn, &ldquo;Herzlich thut mich verlangen,&rdquo; and
later it became associated with &ldquo;O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden.&rdquo;
It was a favorite melody with Bach, who used it five times in his <i>St.
Matthew Passion</i>.</p>
<p>Hans Leo Hassler, 1564-1612, was born at N&uuml;rnberg and died at
Frankfurt at the age of 47. He was a member of a distinguished musical
family. After an early career as organist, he was sent to Venice to
study under Andrea Gabriele, organist of St. Mark&rsquo;s, becoming the
earliest of important German composers to receive an Italian training.
Returning to Germany, Hassler held positions in Augsburg, N&uuml;rnberg,
and elsewhere. His numerous compositions for voice and organ are of
such a standard as to give him a high place in German music, and
most of them have been reprinted in modern times.</p>
<p>J. S. Bach, 1685-1750, who arranged the tune, is by far the greatest
musician the Protestant Church has produced. Most of his life was
spent in Leipzig where he labored from 1723 until his death in 1750,
as cantor of the Thomas School and director of music at the Thomas
and Nicolai churches. His genius as a master of the organ and composer
of chorales and passion music has never been equaled. Though
he lived in an age when opera flourished in Europe, he paid no attention
to it, devoting all his talent to church music. There is something
in his music that touches the deepest chords of religious emotion.</p>

<p>Based on John 1:29: &ldquo;Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away
the sin of the world.&rdquo; The hymn, called the <i>Agnus Dei</i> in liturgical
literature, is a prayer for God&rsquo;s mercy and peace, and a confession that
Christ alone is able to take away the sin of the world. It is an ancient
song which has been in use in the church since 701 A.D. and originally
was chanted antiphonally by clergy and laity. Since the 12th century
the custom has been to repeat the chant three times. In some churches
it is always sung just before the communion of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.</p>
<p>For comments on Decius see <a href="#hymn_521">Hymn 521</a>.</p>
<p>The translation is composite.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">O LAMM GOTTES, UNSCHULDIG</span> is based on an ancient Gregorian
setting for the <i>Agnus Dei</i> and may have been arranged by Decius
himself, for he was a musician as well as a preacher. The word &ldquo;Gregorian&rdquo;
stems from Gregory the Great, who was Pope from 590 to 604
A.D. He was distinguished for his public service and his contribution
to church music, developing the use of the plain chant (also called
&ldquo;plain song&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gregorian chant&rdquo;) which is identified with his name.</p>

<p>An Easter hymn of the first rank, an &ldquo;acknowledged masterpiece of
Christian poetry that will ever remain a treasure among the hallowed
songs of the Evangelical Church.&rdquo; It is based on I Cor. 15:35 ff and
Job 19:25-27.</p>
<p>Luise Henriette, a woman of noble Christian character and a member
of the Reformed Church, was born in The Hague, Holland. She
was married to Elector Friedrich Wilhelm of Brandenburg. Interested
in the economic as well as religious welfare of her people, she founded
model farms, introduced the culture of the Irish potato, and was helpful
in many ways in the restoration of the country after the ravages of
the Thirty Years War. Luise Henriette is credited with numerous
hymns but Julian points out that there is uncertainty whether she
actually wrote all of them or selected them as her favorites. She had
a great admiration for Paul Gerhardt and his poetry.</p>
<p>The hymn is a selection of stanzas 1, 2, 3, and 10. For comments on
Catherine Winkworth, translator, see <a href="#hymn_236">Hymn 236</a>.</p>

<p>The hymn was first published in Gellert&rsquo;s <i>Geistliche Oden und
Lieder</i>, 1757, with the title, &ldquo;Easter Hymn.&rdquo; It soon became popular in
Germany and is widely used now among English speaking people. The
hymn is often used at funerals, and sometimes at the dedication of a
cemetery. Gellert, a saintly Professor of Philosophy and Poetry at
Leipzig, had no fear of death. In the period of the so-called Enlightenment,
when religion had become cold and rationalistic, and the old
hymns had been watered down, he wrote one of our best and most
evangelical hymns.</p>
<p>For comments on the translator, Frances E. Cox, see <a href="#hymn_512">Hymn 512</a>.</p>
<p>The original poem was without the &ldquo;Hallelujah.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">CHRIST IST ERSTANDEN</span> is a traditional German melody dating
to the 13th century. It was used with words beginning, &ldquo;Christ ist
erstanden.&rdquo; Luther said of this tune: &ldquo;after a time one tires of singing
all other hymns, but the &lsquo;Christ ist erstanden&rsquo; one can always sing
again.&rdquo; It is within easy range of all voices and therefore well adapted
for unison singing, though it need not be limited to that.</p>

<p>An Easter song, based on I Cor. 5:7, 8 and Rev. 19:6:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For even Christ our passover suffered for us: therefore let
us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven
of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of
sincerity and truth.</p>
<p>Alleluia! for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weisse&rsquo;s poem is based on &ldquo;Christ is erstanden von der Martyr alle,&rdquo;
the oldest German Easter hymn, found in four versions as early as
the 12th century.</p>
<p>Michael Weisse, born at Neisse, Silesia, about 1480, became a priest,
and for a time was a monk at Breslau. Influenced by the writings of
Luther, he left the monastery to join the Bohemian Brethren, the followers
of John Hus, and became their pastor at Landskron and Fulneck,
Moravia. Weisse was a man of great influence among the Brethren and
was appointed a member of their council. Of a deeply spiritual nature
and possessing rare poetic gifts, he translated the old songs of the Bohemian
Brethren into German and composed many original poems. He
edited the first Brethren hymnbook in German, <i>Ein Neu Gesengbuchlen</i>,
1531, in which the present hymn first appeared. The book, proclaimed
by Luther as &ldquo;the work of a good poet,&rdquo; contains 155 hymns,
all apparently either translations or originals by Weisse himself.</p>
<p>Our translation is by Catherine Winkworth, with stanza 4 omitted.</p>
<p>For comments on Miss Winkworth see <a href="#hymn_236">Hymn 236</a>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">MACHE DICH, MEIN GEIST, BEREIT</span> is an adaptation of a chorale
tune, &ldquo;Straf mich nicht,&rdquo; published in <i>Kirch- und Hausbuch</i>, Dresden,
1694. The composer is not known. Refrains are not commonly
<span class="pb" id="Page_334">334</span>
used with German chorales. The present setting of the tune and
words, with a refrain, was made by the editors especially for the
<i>Hymnary</i>. It is suitable for children&rsquo;s choirs as well as for congregational
use.</p>

<div class="author"><i>Frederick L. Hosmer</i>, 1840-1929</div>
<p>A joyous Easter song in which the springtime awakening in nature
symbolizes the newness of spiritual life.</p>
<p>For comments on Frederick L. Hosmer see <a href="#hymn_72">Hymn 72</a>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">SALZBURG</span> appeared in the 19th edition of Cr&uuml;ger&rsquo;s <i>Praxis
Pietatis Melica</i>, 1678, a work which contained the main stream of Lutheran
hymnody in the middle of the 17th century. The tune was set
to the hymn, &ldquo;Alle Menschen m&uuml;ssen sterben.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The composer, Jacob Hintze, 1622-1702, was born in Bernau, Brandenburg.
He became court musician to the Elector of Brandenburg, in
Berlin, in 1666, and in the year 1662 succeeded Cr&uuml;ger, upon the latter&rsquo;s
death, as editor of the <i>Praxis</i>. The present version, slightly altered
from the original, is from J. S. Bach&rsquo;s <i>Choralges&auml;nge</i>. The tune is
also associated with Stopford Brooke&rsquo;s hymn, &ldquo;Let the whole creation

<p>This hymn for Whitsuntide, addressed to the Holy Spirit, went
through various alterations in German hymnbooks until it finally appeared
in 8 stanzas, as here. It is a beautiful New Testament paraphrase
of Isa. 11:2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit
of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might,
the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Michael Schirmer, born in Leipzig, received his education at the
University of Leipzig, graduating with an M.A. degree in 1630. He was
appointed assistant rector of the Greyfriars Gymnasium in Berlin, but
on account of ill health was compelled to resign. Besides the hardships
of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, Schirmer experienced added sorrows in the
death of his wife and two children. At times deep melancholy fell upon
him, lasting for years at a time. Schirmer was crowned court poet in
1637. His published works include a metrical version of <i>Ecclesiasticus</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_336">336</span>
1655; a scriptural play, <i>Der verfolgte David</i>, 1660; and versions of the
Songs of the Old and New Testaments, <i>Biblische Lieder und Lehrspr&uuml;che</i>,
1650. Five of his hymns came into wide use in Germany but
only this one passed into English.</p>
<p>The translation is by Catherine Winkworth in her <i>Chorale Book for
England</i>, 1863. The present hymn is composed of stanzas 1, 4, 6, and 8.</p>

<p>The original hymn, in six stanzas, first appeared in Johann Niedling&rsquo;s
<i>Lutherisches-Altenburgisches Handb&uuml;chlein</i>, Naumburg, 1651.
Some of the hymns in this collection are original with Niedling, and
bear his name. This hymn, however, appears anonymously, leaving
doubt as to its authorship. The <i>Common Service Book</i> of the United
Lutheran Church credits it to Niedling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_337">337</div>
<p>The English translation was made especially for the <i>United Lutheran
Hymnal</i>, in 1913, employing the first four stanzas of the original.</p>
<p>The translator, John Casper Mattes, was born in Easton, Pa. After
graduating from Lafayette College and Mt. Airy Theological Seminary,
he served as pastor of the Church of the Saviour, Trenton, N. J., 1901-15,
and St. John Lutheran Church, Scranton, Pa., 1915-38. From 1939
until his death in 1948 he was a teacher at the Wartburg Theological
Seminary, Dubuque, Iowa. Mattes was a frequent contributor to
Lutheran publications and served on the United Lutheran Church
Common Service Book Committee. He was a member of the Intersynodical
Committee on translation of Luther&rsquo;s <i>Small Catechism</i>, and
is translator of Koberle&rsquo;s <i>Rechtfertigung und Heiligung</i>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">O HEILIGER GEIST, O HEILIGER GOTT</span>, also called &ldquo;O Jesulein
S&uuml;ss,&rdquo; first appears in <i>Auserlesene Catholische Geistliche Kirchenges&auml;ng</i>,
Cologne, 1623, set to the hymn, &ldquo;Ist das der Leib, Herr Jesu Christ.&rdquo;
In <i>Christliche Seelenharfe</i>, Halle, 1650, it is set to &ldquo;Komm heiliger
Geist, mit deinen Genad&rdquo; while in S. Scheldt&rsquo;s <i>Tabulatur Buch</i>, G&ouml;rlitz,
1650, it is used with the hymn, &ldquo;O Jesulein s&uuml;ss, O Jesulein mild.&rdquo;
The melody appears in many later collections, both Catholic and
Protestant. Its present form, a variant of Scheldt&rsquo;s, appeared in the
<i>Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch</i>, Leipzig, 1682, set to the hymn, &ldquo;O heiliger
Geist, O heiliger Gott.&rdquo; It is an attractive tune in triple time, of the
type associated with early German carols.</p>
<p>Samuel Scheidt, 1587-1654, the composer, was born at Halle, the son
of Conrad Scheidt, overseer of the salt works. He had for his teacher
the famous Peter Sweelinck of Amsterdam, and became a noted organist
and composer. His <i>Tabulatura Nova</i>, 1624, set a new standard in organ
playing, by showing how to make it less ostentatious and more meaningful
and coherent. His great work, <i>Tablaturbuch</i>, is a series of harmonized
chorales, published in three parts, 1624-53.</p>

<p>A fine hymn of invocation to the Holy Spirit, written for Whitsuntide,
in 9 stanzas.</p>
<p>The author, Heinrich Held, a lawyer by profession, was born in
Guhrau, Silesia. After receiving his education at the Universities of
K&ouml;nigsberg, Frankfurt a. Oder, and Leyden, he practiced law in his
home town of Guhrau where he lived all his life. He became one of
the best Silesian poets and hymn writers, probably because he was
taught in the school of affliction and suffering, brought about by the
Thirty Years&rsquo; War.</p>
<p>The translation is by Charles W. Schaeffer, a native of Hagerstown,
Maryland. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania and
the Theological Seminary at Gettysburg, he held several pastorates and
then became a teacher in the Lutheran Theological Seminary in Philadelphia.
Our hymn is a selection of stanzas 1, 2, 7, and 8.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">EISENACH</span>, also known as &ldquo;St. Leonard,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Komm, O
komm, du Geist des Lebens,&rdquo; is an attractive melody, composed by
Johann Christoph Bach, 1642-1703, an excellent musician, and a first
<span class="pb" id="Page_339">339</span>
cousin of the father of the eminent Johann Sebastian Bach. He was
organist at Eisenach where he spent most of his life. The name of the
tune is derived from Bach&rsquo;s town. Much of the music he composed is
extant, mostly in manuscript, but some keyboard and choral music is
in print. His motet, <i>I wrestle and pray</i>, was published by Novello.</p>

<p>James Moffatt names this the &ldquo;greatest hymn of the greatest man in
the greatest period of German history.&rdquo; More than any other, this
hymn has transcended all national boundaries and denominational
<span class="pb" id="Page_340">340</span>
lines, and has become a truly ecumenical church song. It has been
translated into nearly two hundred languages. &ldquo;Ein feste Burg&rdquo; was
sung over Luther&rsquo;s grave at Wittenberg in the Schloss-Kirche, on the
door of which some 30 years before, he had nailed his 95 theses against
Roman Indulgences. The hymn has been used at many historic occasions
and conventions. In 1925, at the meeting of Christians from all
parts of the world in Stockholm, the opening hymn was &ldquo;Ein&rsquo; feste Burg
ist unser Gott.&rdquo; Each delegate sang in his own tongue, but it was the
same tune, the same hymn and the same spirit; and the great conference,
assembled to consider the life and mission of the church,
adopted the hymn as an ecumenical symbol. It was adopted as the
Conference hymn for the fourth Mennonite World Conference held at
Goshen, Ind., and North Newton, Kan., August 3-10, 1948.</p>
<p>The hymn arose out of the writer&rsquo;s conflict with the evil forces of the
world and the corrupt hierarchy of a corrupt church. When Luther was
summoned to the Diet of Worms, he was warned by his friends not to
go. He ignored their advice, and, standing before that assemblage of
emperors and principalities and powers, he spoke these memorable
words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is neither safe nor prudent to do aught against conscience.
Till such time as either by proof from holy Scripture
or by fair reason or argument I have been confuted and convicted,
I cannot and will not recant. Here I stand. I cannot
do otherwise. God be my help. Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is against this background of opposition and trouble that the
great hymn was penned.</p>
<p>There are more than sixty versions of the hymn in the English
language. The translation used here is by Frederick H. Hedge, then
Professor of Ecclesiastical History, and later of German Literature, at
Harvard. It is the commonly accepted version in America. In England,
the translation by Thomas Carlysle is the most widely used.</p>
<p>For ordinary occasions the use of the first two stanzas is sufficient.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">EIN&rsquo; FESTE BURG IST UNSER GOTT</span>, also by Luther, is one of
the great chorales destined to be sung to the end of time. It is perfectly
adapted to the words and especially effective with large congregations.
The musical merits of the tune have been recognized by the great
masters. Mendelssohn used the tune in the last movement of his <i>Reformation
Symphony</i> and Bach used it in several of his cantatas.</p>
<p>Albert Schweitzer writes of this melody:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ein feste Burg&rdquo; is woven out of Gregorian reminiscences.
The recognition of this fact deprives the melody of none of its
beauty and Luther of none of the credit for it. It really takes
considerable talent to create an organic unity out of fragments.</p>

<p>A missionary hymn written at the request of students at the Basel
Mission House, Basel, Switzerland. The students wanted a good missionary
poem to use with the present tune, then erroneously ascribed
to J. Michael Haydn. Preiswerk supplied the first two stanzas. They
were first sung June 17, 1829, at an anniversary festival. The third
stanza was added by Count Felician von Zaremba, since it was felt that
the first two did not have enough emphasis on foreign missions.</p>
<p>The hymn was sung at the laying of the cornerstone of Bethel College
and again at the sixtieth anniversary of that event, celebrated October
12, 1948.</p>
<p>Samuel Preiswerk was born in R&uuml;mlingen, Switzerland, the son of the
pastor of the Reformed Church at that place. He was educated at the
Universities of Basel, T&uuml;bingen, and Erlangen. After serving in a curacy
at Benken and on the staff of the Basel Orphanage, he taught Hebrew
at the Basel Mission House, later accepting a pastorate at Muttenz,
and a professorship at the Ecole de Th&eacute;ologie in Geneva. In 1840
he was called to the St. Leonhardt Church in Basel, where he became the
<span class="pb" id="Page_342">342</span>
main pastor in 1843. Finally he was made Antistes or Superintendent
of the Reformed Churches in the Basel Area. Preiswerk was one of the
editors of the <i>Baseler Gesangbuch</i> of 1854 and was otherwise active as
a hymnologist.</p>
<p>Felician von Zaremba, author of the third stanza, was born at
Zaroy, Poland, and died in Basel. A descendant of an old Polish noble
family, he received a good education at the University of Dorpat, excelling
in languages. Although he prepared himself for the diplomatic
service to Russia, he became greatly interested in the missionary
work centering in Basel, and eventually entered the work carried on
among the Mohammedans and Nestorians in South Russia and the
Caucasus regions. For many years he was an itinerant preacher in Germany
and Switzerland.</p>
<p>The translator, Julius Henry Horstmann, was born at Naperville,
Ill., and is living in retirement at Maplewood, Mo. He was educated at
Northwestern College, Elmhurst College and Eden Theological Seminary.
He served churches in Indiana and Texas and from 1906 to
1936 was editor of the <i>Evangelical Herald</i>.</p>

<p>One of the best and most useful hymns for Foreign Missions. It has
been rendered into English by such eminent translators as Frances Cox,
H. J. Buckoll, and Catherine Winkworth. But in order to make a freer
and more modern use of the original, Percy Dearmer made this new
<span class="pb" id="Page_343">343</span>
translation for <i>Songs of Praise</i>, London, 1931, of which he was the
editor.</p>
<p>For comments on J. F. Bahnmaier see <a href="#hymn_329">Hymn 329</a>.</p>
<p>Percy Dearmer was born in London and educated at Oxford. After
serving as vicar in the church of St. Mary the Virgin, Primrose Hill, he
became Professor of Ecclesiastical Art at King&rsquo;s College, London. He
was an authority on hymnology and liturgies, and wrote extensively
on these subjects. His works include <i>The New Reformation</i>, <i>A Short
Handbook of Public Worship</i>, <i>The Story of the Prayer Book</i>, and
<i>Songs of Praise Discussed</i>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">GOTT SEI DANK</span> appeared in Freylinghausen&rsquo;s <i>Geistreiches
Gesangbuch</i>, Halle, 1704, where it is set to the hymn, &ldquo;Gott sei Dank
in aller Welt.&rdquo; It is also called &ldquo;L&uuml;beck,&rdquo; &ldquo;Berlin,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Carinthia.&rdquo;
The composer is unknown.</p>

<p>The finest of all German communion hymns. It expresses the reverent
joy that should accompany the sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.
The hymn is sung, invariably, in many German churches on communion
occasions.</p>
<p>Johann Franck was born at Guben, Brandenburg, the son of a lawyer,
and was himself educated for the law. At the University of K&ouml;nigsberg
he was greatly influenced by Simon Dach, Professor of Poetry, and,
in spite of his law practice and the holding of public offices, he became
an important poet and hymn writer of his time, second only to Paul
Gerhardt. The dominant theme of his hymns is the mystical union of
the soul with the Savior. Franck&rsquo;s hymns had appeared in the works of
his friends Weichman and Cr&uuml;ger, and later were published, 110 in
all, at Guben, in 1674, in a volume entitled <i>Geistliches Sion</i>.</p>
<p>The hymn is a selection of stanzas 1, 2, 7, and 9 of the original.</p>
<p>For comments on the translator, Catherine Winkworth, see <a href="#hymn_236">Hymn 236</a>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">SCHM&Uuml;CKE DICH</span> is a beautifully expressive tune by Johann
Cr&uuml;ger, 1598-1662, first published in the composer&rsquo;s <i>Praxis Pietatis
Melica</i>, 1644. J. S. Bach used the tune for an organ setting which
constitutes one of the most beautiful of Bach organ chorales. Upon
hearing it played by Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann wrote concerning
the chorale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Round the <i>cantus firmus</i> hung golden garlands of leaves, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_345">345</span>
such blissfulness was breathed from within it, that you yourself
avowed that if life was bereft of all hope and faith, this one
chorale could renew them for you. I was silent and went away
dazed into God&rsquo;s acre, feeling acutely pained that I could lay
no flower on his urn.</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">LIEBSTER JESU</span> appeared in the <i>Alterdorfer Gesangbuch</i>,
1671, set to the words, &ldquo;Liebster Jesus, wir sind hier,&rdquo; by Tobias Clausnitzer.
J. S. Bach made a setting for the tune, used in some hymn books,
and also arranged it as a chorale prelude for the organ.</p>
<p>The composer of the tune, Johann Rudolph Ahle, 1625-73, received
his education at the Universities of G&ouml;ttingen and Erfurt. He was
elected Cantor of St. Andreas&rsquo; Church, and director of the music school,
at Erfurt. Interested also in civic affairs, he was elected to the town
council at M&uuml;hlhausen in 1656, and made mayor in 1661. He became
one of the most radical reformers of church music, cultivating the simple
chorale style and avoiding the polyphonic counterpoint then in use.
Ahle wrote over 400 songs, many of which are still in use among the
Protestant churches of England and America.</p>

<p>Based on Acts 10:33: &ldquo;Now therefore are we all here present before
God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.&rdquo; The third
stanza is reminiscent of a phrase in the Nicene creed: &ldquo;God of God,
Light of Light, begotten, not made.&rdquo; The hymn, written to be sung by
the congregation just before the reading of the Scripture lesson, has had
wide use among German speaking churches.</p>
<p>Tobias Clausnitzer was born at Thum, Saxony. He graduated from
the University of Leipzig in 1643 and became a chaplain in the Swedish
army, for a time, during the Thirty Years&rsquo; War. In 1649 he became
minister at Weiden where he remained until his death.</p>

<p>One of the best and most spirited of morning hymns, &ldquo;as if born
from the dew of the sunrise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The author, Christian Knorr, Baron von Rosenroth, was the son of
a Silesian pastor. After years of study and travel, he also settled down
to a pastorate in Silesia. He was well versed in philosophy and chemistry,
as well as theology, and his memory was so remarkable that he
knew nearly the whole Bible by heart. He took special interest in the
study of the Jewish Kabbala, the so-called secret wisdom of the rabbis,
and his writings on this literature made him world famous. Knorr
wrote seventy hymns, the present being the only one now in general use
among English speaking people.</p>
<p>The translator, Richard Massie, was the son of the Rev. R. Massie, a
minister in the Anglican church. A man of wealth and leisure, he was
able to devote himself to literature and gardening. His rock garden, a
rare thing in those days, attracted wide attention. Massie and his mother
and sisters are remembered for their quiet spirituality and saintliness.</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">INNSBRUCK</span> is commonly attributed to Heinrich Isaak, <i>c.</i> 1460-<i>c.</i> 1527,
a German or Dutch (it is not certain which) born musician
who spent most of his life in Italy, an eminent organist and composer.
Isaak was kapellmeister of Lorenzo the Magnificent and later of Maximilian
of Vienna. The tune was first published, so far as is known, in
N&uuml;rnberg, 1539, in a different version, set to the words, &ldquo;Innsbruck
ich muss dich lassen.&rdquo; Later it was adapted to the hymn, &ldquo;O Welt ich
muss dich lassen,&rdquo; and then to Gerhardt&rsquo;s evening hymn, &ldquo;Nun ruhen
alle W&auml;lder.&rdquo; The melody has appeared in many different forms in
German collections. The arrangement here is that made by J. S. Bach
and used in his <i>St. Matthew Passion</i> and elsewhere.</p>

<p>The author, Nikolaus Selnecker, an ardent Lutheran, was a scholar
and accomplished musician. He became church organist when only
twelve years old and afterwards, in succession, lecturer at the University
of Wittenberg, Professor of Theology at Jena, and pastor of St.
Thomas&rsquo; Church at Leipzig. He wrote Latin verse and composed many
German hymns but is chiefly known through this evening hymn. The
English rendering of it we owe to Robert Bridges&rsquo; <i>Yattendon Hymnal</i>.
It was made to suit Bach&rsquo;s setting of the Proper tune, and freely though
finely expands stanzas 1 and 9 of the original.</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ACH BLEIB BEI UNS</span>, &ldquo;one of the most famous of German
chorales,&rdquo; appeared in <i>Geistliche Lieder</i>, Leipzig, 1589, and in other
contemporary collections.</p>
<p>The composer, Seth Calvisius, 1556-1615, was the son of poor parents,
but succeeded in obtaining an education at the Universities of
Helmstedt and Leipzig. He was an astronomer and chronologer, besides
being a musician, and was offered the Chair of Mathematics at
Wittenberg in 1611. Calvisius refused the offer in order to devote himself
to music. After holding various musical posts in churches in Leipzig
and Schulpforta, he became music director at the Thomaskirche in
the former city. Calvisius wrote treatises on the theory of music and
published several collections of his own and others&rsquo; music, among them
<i>Hymni Sacri Latini et Germanici</i>, 1594, in which this tune appears in
the alto as a descant to another melody. The present version is from
J. S. Bach&rsquo;s <i>Vierstimmige Choralges&auml;nge</i>, 1769.</p>

<p>This &ldquo;Hymn of Trust&rdquo; is Gerhardt&rsquo;s finest lyric. It is based on Psalm
37:5: &ldquo;Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shall
bring it to pass.&rdquo; The initial words of each stanza form an acrostic of
the German version: &ldquo;Befiehl dem Herrn deine Wege, und hoff auf
ihn; er wird es wohlmachen.&rdquo; The hymn first appeared in Cr&uuml;ger&rsquo;s
<i>Praxis</i>, 1646. It expresses the simple trust in God that supported Gerhardt
through the troubles that arose out of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, as
well as his own personal sorrows.</p>
<p>For comments on Gerhardt see <a href="#hymn_134">Hymn 134</a>.</p>
<p>Of the many translations of this hymn, this one by John Wesley remains
the most popular. It was published in 16 four-line stanzas in his
<i>Hymns and Sacred Poems</i>, 1739, with the title, &ldquo;Trust in Providence.&rdquo;
Since the hymn was written in Short Meter, the editors of the <i>Hymnary</i>
had to abridge the third line of each stanza to fit this tune with its
7.6.7.6. meter, a practice which Wesley himself would have heartily
condemned. Wesley&rsquo;s unaltered version of his eight stanzas used here
are as follows:</p>
<h6 class="vn">1.</h6>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">Commit thou all thy griefs</p>
<p class="t">And ways into His hands,</p>

<p>A simple and beautiful hymn, having as its keynote the saying of
the two disciples at Emmaus: &ldquo;Abide with us: for it is toward evening,
and the day is far spent&rdquo; (Lk. 24:29). It originally appeared in the
author&rsquo;s <i>Christliches Gebetsb&uuml;chlein</i>, Rinteln, 1627, and later in his
<i>Erneuerte Hertzen-Seufzer</i>, 1630, under the title, &ldquo;For the Blessing and
Support of the Ministry,&rdquo; to be used as a closing hymn after the &ldquo;Prayer
for the Preservation of the Doctrine, and of the Church of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our version is a free translation of stanzas 1 to 3 as it appeared,
anonymously, in the Dalston Hospital <i>Hymn Book</i>, 1848, and as repeated
in the Pennsylvania Lutheran <i>Church Book</i>, 1868.</p>
<p>Josua Stegmann, son of a Lutheran pastor, was born at S&uuml;lzfeld,
Germany. He was educated at the Universities of Leipzig and Wittenberg.
After holding several positions as teacher and pastor, he became
Professor of Theology at Rinteln. With the outbreak of the Thirty
Years&rsquo; War, he was forced to flee but returned after several years. He
suffered much at the hands of his Catholic opponents. Benedictine
monks claimed to be the rightful professors and demanded the restoration
of certain church properties. At one time soldiers were sent into
Stegmann&rsquo;s house, demanding a refund of his salary, compelling him to
a public disputation, and otherwise subjecting him to humiliation.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ACH BLEIB MIT DEINER GNADE</span> is a simple but lovely tune, permeated
<span class="pb" id="Page_356">356</span>
with a feeling of deep serenity, fitting the present hymn perfectly.
It appeared in the composer&rsquo;s <i>Ein Sch&ouml;n Geistlich Gesangbuch</i>,
Jena, 1609, set to the hymn, &ldquo;Christus, der ist mein Leben,&rdquo; by which
name the tune is also known. J. S. Bach used the melody in his chorale
cantata, <i>Christus, der ist mein Leben</i>.</p>
<p>The composer, Melchior Vulpius, c. 1560-1616, was precentor at
Weimar about 1600. He composed a number of tunes and published
them in his <i>Ein sch&ouml;n geistlich Gesangbuch, &amp;c., durch M.V. Cantorem
zu Weymar</i>. Others of his tunes were published after his death.</p>

<p>Julie von Haussmann, born in Mitau, in the province of Kurland,
was the second youngest of a family of six daughters. Her father had
been a teacher in a Gymnasium at Riga, later moving to Mitau where
he held a government position. Julie, never in vigorous health, was a
shy, retiring young woman, but keen of intellect. On several occasions
she accepted positions as governess in private homes but was always compelled
to give up on account of her health. She finally dismissed all
thoughts of a career and devoted herself to the care of her father who
had become blind, until the latter&rsquo;s death in 1864. The following two
years she lived with a married sister in Germany and Switzerland and
then accompanied her younger sister to Biarritz in southern France
where the latter held a position as organist. In 1870 both went to St.
Petersburg to be with two other sisters, one of them employed as Director
<span class="pb" id="Page_358">358</span>
of St. Annenschule. The family circle was broken in 1896 and
1898 upon the death of the youngest and oldest sister. In 1901 Julie
settled with relatives near W&ouml;sso in Estonia. In spite of old age and
weak eyesight, she was busily engaged, until her death, with charities
and literary work. She published a devotional book, <i>Hausbrot</i>, and,
upon the insistence of a friend, Gustav Knak, her lyrics were published
in three volumes, entitled, <i>Maiblumen. Lieder einer Stillen im Lande</i>.
&ldquo;So nimm denn mein H&auml;nde&rdquo; appeared in <i>Maiblumen</i>, 1862, Vol I.
It has been translated into many languages.</p>

a German musician, born at Schnaith, W&uuml;rttemberg. For 43 years Silcher
was the director of music and organist at the University of T&uuml;bingen.
He composed popular songs and hymns, and a cantata.</p>

<p>Based on I Tim. 1:13: &ldquo;aber mir ist Barmherzigkeit widerfahren&rdquo;

<p>The hymn appeared first in Hiller&rsquo;s <i>Geistliches Liederk&auml;stlein</i>, Part
II, 1767, with the following note by the author:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An unconverted person is much too proud to say these words
sincerely from the heart; but the converted person confesses
them freely before God and man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For comments on the author, Philipp Friedrich Hiller, see <a href="#hymn_524">Hymn 524</a>.
The hymn is credited, erroneously, to Gerhard Tersteegen, in the
<i>Hymnary</i>.</p>
<p>A number of Hiller&rsquo;s hymns have been translated but this one apparently
had never before been put into English. Our translation, consisting
of stanzas 1, 2, 4, and 5, was made especially for the <i>Hymnary</i> by
Sister Frieda Kaufman who was for many years associated with the
Bethel Deaconess Hospital, Newton, Kansas. Sister Frieda was born near
Basel, Switzerland; came with her parents to Halstead, Kansas; and attended
Bethel College. After graduating from a nursing course in Cincinnati,
Ohio, she received her deaconess garb and has since been known
as &ldquo;Sister Frieda.&rdquo; From 1908 to 1943 she served as sister-in-charge of
the hospital and during much of that time served also as its superintendent.
She had much to do with the planning of the Home for the
Aged which is operated in connection with the hospital. To these two
institutions she devoted her rare gifts and set for them a high standard of
Christian service. Sister Frieda had unusual literary and artistic endowments
and translated several German hymns into English.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">ERBARMUNG</span> is a popular Swiss melody which appeared anonymously
in the <i>Gesangbuch mit Noten</i>. It was composed by Johann
Gottfried Schicht, 1753-1823, who was born in Zittau. Schicht composed
3 oratorios, church and chamber music, and edited Bach&rsquo;s motets.
He became cantor of the Thomasschule in Leipzig in 1810.</p>

<p>Based on the following scripture passages: (1) Stanzas 1 to 5, Luke
13:24: &ldquo;Strive to enter in at the strait gate; for many, I say unto you,
shall seek to enter in, and shall not be able;&rdquo; (2) stanzas 6 to 15, Philippians
2:12: &ldquo;Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;&rdquo;
(3) stanzas 16 to 24, Genesis 19:15-22: &ldquo;Haste thee, escape thither,&rdquo; and
the story of Lot&rsquo;s flight from Sodom.</p>
<p>Johann J. Winckler was a Lutheran pastor of the early Pietistic
group. After receiving his education in the University of Leipzig, he
held important church posts in the city of Magdeburg, climaxed by his
appointment as chief preacher at the Cathedral. He made enemies in
Magdeburg on several occasions, first, by his stand against theater-going,
and afterwards, by his well-meant though futile attempt to bring about
a closer union between the Lutheran and Reformed Churches in Prussia.
But he bore his opposition with Christian patience and fortitude.
His hymns, all of them lengthy, are distinguished by a firm faith and
earnestness. They represent the better productions of the early Pietistic
writers of Germany.</p>
<p>Our version is a translation of stanzas 1, 13, and 16, by Miss Winkworth,

<p>In its depth of spiritual experience, this hymn by Franck resembles
Wesley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jesus, lover of my soul.&rdquo; It has made a wide appeal and the
words have been translated into various tongues. Peter the Great, the
irreligious Czar of Russia, of all people, had the hymn done into the
Russian language, and it has also been translated into Estonian.</p>

<p>Based on Matt. 16:24: &ldquo;If any man will come after me, let him deny
himself, and take up his cross and follow me.&rdquo; The hymn has been
called a &ldquo;masterpiece of scriptural didactic poetry.&rdquo; It appeared first
in the author&rsquo;s <i>Heilige Seelenlust</i>, 1668.</p>
<p>Johann Scheffler, author of the hymn, holds a high place in the
first rank of German poets. Born in Breslau, Silesia, the son of Lutheran
parents, he studied in the Universities of Strassburg, Leyden, and Padua,
graduating with the degrees of Ph.D. and M.D. Early in life he became
<span class="pb" id="Page_364">364</span>
deeply interested in the famous shoemaker, Jacob B&ouml;hme, a mystic
and writer of popular books on the inner life. As a result of his studies
in mysticism, Scheffler left the Lutherans and became a priest in the
Roman Catholic Church. He then gave up the medical profession to
devote himself to writing and the priesthood. Scheffler&rsquo;s hymns, on the
whole, are, however, not distinctly Roman Catholic in sentiment, and
they became much more popular among the Lutherans and Moravians
than among the Catholics. Scheffler wrote under the nom de plume,
&ldquo;Angelus Silesius,&rdquo; &ldquo;Angelus&rdquo; being the name of a Spanish mystic who
influenced him greatly, to which he added &ldquo;Silesius&rdquo; to indicate his native
country.</p>
<p>The translation was made especially for the <i>Hymnary</i>, by Mrs. Joanna
Andres, Newton, Kansas. The hymn is unusual in its use of the personal
pronoun &ldquo;I&rdquo; in the first three stanzas.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">MIR NACH! SPRICHT CHRISTUS UNSER HELD</span> is a popular tune
composed by Johann Hermann Schein (misspelled &ldquo;Rhein&rdquo; in the

1878:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is one of the most widely used and signally blessed hymns
and has not unjustly been called his &ldquo;Master Song.&rdquo; If it is
somewhat &ldquo;home baked&rdquo; yet it is excellent, nourishing bread.
It gives a training in practical Christianity and especially strikes
three notes&mdash;godly living, patient suffering, and happy dying.</p>

<p>Based on Deut. 32:4: &ldquo;He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his
ways are judgment; a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right
is he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Samuel Rodigast, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Jena,
and later rector of the Greyfriars Gymnasium in Berlin, wrote this hymn
for his friend Severus Gastorius, precentor of the church at Jena, when
Gastorius was ill. Gastorius in turn composed the tune on his sick bed,
requesting that the hymn be sung at his funeral. The condition of his
health turned for the better whereupon Gastorius ordered his choir to
sing the hymn at the door of his house once each week during the
period of his convalescence. The music and words became widely known
and are used throughout the whole of German Protestantism. The
hymn appeared first in <i>Hannoversches Gesangbuch</i>, 1676. The melody
appeared in the <i>Auserlesenes Weimarisches Gesangbuch</i>, 1681.</p>
<p>The translation, stanzas 1, 2, and 6 of the original, is Miss Winkworth&rsquo;s
in her <i>Chorale Book for England</i>, 1863.</p>

<p>A prayer for the spirit of grace rightly to praise and worship God,
based on John 16:23-28. The hymn was first published in <i>Geistreiches
Gesangbuch</i>, Halle, 1697, and appeared again in Freylinghausen&rsquo;s <i>Gesangbuch</i>,
1704.</p>
<p>Bartholom&auml;us Crasselius, son of a cooper, was born in Wernsdorf,
Saxony. He became an ardent disciple of A. H. Francke, leader of
the Pietistic movement at Halle. Crasselius was an aggressive advocate
of the new life. As Lutheran pastor at Nidda, and later at D&uuml;sseldorf,
he was known for his unrestrained testimony against the people and the
times. Crasselius was nearly always in conflict with the authorities and
at one time was suspended four weeks from his office and punished with
fines and imprisonment.</p>
<p>The translation, consisting of stanzas 1 and 2, is somewhat altered
from Catherine Winkworth&rsquo;s as it appeared in her <i>Chorale Book for
England</i>, 1863.</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">DIR, DIR JEHOVAH</span> has been coupled with this text since its
first publication in 1704 in Freylinghausen&rsquo;s <i>Gesangbuch</i>. It is an
altered form of a melody set to &ldquo;Wer nur den lieben Gott l&auml;sst walten,&rdquo;
published in the <i>Musikalisches Handbuch</i>, Hamburg, 1690. The composer
is not known. In England the tune was altered to fit the long
meter hymn, &ldquo;Ride on, ride on in majesty,&rdquo; and is called &ldquo;Winchester

<p>One of the most popular of the German hymns. The heading given
it by the author was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Song of Comfort. God will care for and help every one
in His own time. Cast thy burden on the Lord and He shall
sustain thee. Psalm 55:22.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hymn arose out of the author&rsquo;s personal need and suffering. On
his way to K&ouml;nigsberg, to attend the University at that place, Neumark
was robbed of his money and stripped of all his possessions except his
prayer book and a small amount of cash which, he had sewn into his
clothing. He was therefore destitute and in despair, with no prospect
<span class="pb" id="Page_370">370</span>
of going to school or making a living. After many privations, he at
last received an appointment as private tutor in the family of a judge at
Kiel, &ldquo;which good fortune, coming suddenly and as if fallen from
heaven,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;greatly rejoiced me, and on that very day I composed
to the honour of my beloved Lord the hymn, well known here
and there, &lsquo;Wer nur den lieben Gott l&auml;sst walten,&rsquo; and had certainly
cause enough to thank the Divine compassion for such unlooked-for
grace shown to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neumark was now able to enter the University and became a student
of law and poetry. After years of hardship, he finally had the good fortune
of being appointed court poet, librarian, and registrar to Duke
Wilhelm II of Saxe-Weimar, and custodian of the ducal archives. Shortly
before his death in 1681 he became blind. The hymns he wrote during
his prosperous years were markedly inferior to those written during
his earlier years of hardship and privation.</p>
<p>The translation was made by Rev. J. J. Voth, North Newton, Kansas,
then a member of the Bethel College staff, and pastor of the Gnadenberg
Mennonite Church near Whitewater, Kansas. There is also a fine
translation of this hymn, by Catherine Winkworth.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">WER NUR DEN LIEBEN GOTT</span> is wrongly attributed in the
<i>Hymnary</i> to the author of the words. Neumark wrote an extraordinarily
fine tune, in the minor mode, for these words, used in many collections,
including the Canadian Mennonite <i>Gesangbuch</i>, 1942. The present
tune is simpler and more popular than Neumark&rsquo;s. The composer is
not known.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_572">572. Our Lord, His passion ended</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Francis C. Burkitt</i>, 1864&mdash;</div>
<p>A hymn for Whitsuntide.</p>
<p>Francis Crawford Burkitt, born in London, is a scholar of wide repute
in England, the author of many linguistic and theological works. He
holds honorary degrees from the Universities of Edinburgh, Dublin,
St. Andrews, and Oxford. Burkitt was, for many years, Professor of Divinity
in Cambridge University.</p>
<p>The meter of the hymn is unique in that the second quatrain of
each stanza changes from the common lambic (- &mdash;) to the Trochaic
(&mdash; -).</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">FORTEM VIRILI PECTORE</span>, of unknown origin, has much of
the character of a German folk tune. It appears in various editions
of the <i>Catholisches Gesangbuch</i>, Strassburg, 1697 and onwards, set to
a German version of the words, &ldquo;Fortem virili pectore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A morning hymn. Stanzas 2, 3, and 5 were special favorites in Germany,
<span class="pb" id="Page_372">372</span>
stanza 5 having been adopted by children, by brides, by old and
young, as a morning prayer. Concerning this hymn, Dr. Cosack, a
K&ouml;nigsberg writer, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For two hundred years it is hardly likely that a single day
has greeted the earth that has not, here and there, in German
lands, been met with Albert&rsquo;s hymn. Hardly another morning
hymn can be compared with it, as far as popularity and intrinsic
value are concerned, if simplicity and devotion, purity
of doctrine and adaptation to all the circumstances of life are
to decide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author, Heinrich Albert, was the son of a tax collector at
Lobenstein, Voigtland. He began the study of music under his uncle,
Heinrich Sch&uuml;tz, Court Kapellmeister at Dresden, but abandoned it, at
the desire of his parents, to become a lawyer. The profession of law
had, however, little interest for him and he returned to his first love,
accepting, in 1631, the position of organist of the Cathedral of K&ouml;nigsberg.
Albert wrote several hundred secular and sacred poems and
composed in all 78 sacred melodies. Most of the former were published
in his <i>Etliche Arien</i>.</p>
<p>The hymn has been rendered into English by five or six eminent
translators. Johann Christian Jacobi, a native of Germany who was
Keeper of the Royal German Chapel, St. James Palace, London, for
42 years, made a translation of this hymn which he included in his
<i>Divine Hymns</i>, 1720. Our second stanza, slightly altered, is the work
of his hand.</p>
<p>Arthur Tozer Russell, an Anglican clergyman and prolific writer,
translated many hymns and composed about 140 original hymns besides
a large number of chants and hymn tunes. To him belongs the credit
for our 3d stanza which is a translation of stanza 6 of the original.
Russell&rsquo;s translations, on the whole, are &ldquo;vigorous and strong, but
somewhat ultra-faithful to the original metres.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine Winkworth made a full translation of Albert&rsquo;s hymn for
her <i>Lyra Germanica</i>, 1st Ser. 1855. Our first verse is taken from this
work.</p>
<p>For comments on Miss Winkworth see <a href="#hymn_236">Hymn 236</a>.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">GOTT DES HIMMELS UND DER ERDEN</span> was composed by Albert,
author of the words. The tune is known too by the names &ldquo;Godesberg,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Waltham.&rdquo; (See <a href="#hymn_370">Hymn 370</a>). J. S. Bach used the melody in his

<p>Entitled, &ldquo;Following Christ.&rdquo; The hymn has become a great favorite
in Germany, especially as a children&rsquo;s hymn. Stanzas 1, 3 and 4 are
from Zinzendorf&rsquo;s &ldquo;Seelenbr&auml;utigam, O du Gotteslamm,&rdquo; a poem of
11 stanzas, written September 1721. The second stanza is from &ldquo;Glanz
der Ewigkeit,&rdquo; a 15-stanza poem, dated Berlin, May 1721.</p>
<p>Nicolaus Ludwig, Graf von Zinzendorf, was born at Dresden of a
noble, wealthy and religious family. Early in life he came under
the teaching of influential Pietists, having Philipp Spener for his
godfather and Augustus Francke for his tutor. From his earliest years
he had strong religious impressions. As a child his favorite play was
&ldquo;preaching;&rdquo; as a boy in school he organized the &ldquo;Order of the Mustard
Seed,&rdquo; the members of which bound themselves in a special manner
to the service of Christ, and above all to promote the conversion of
the heathen. Upon the insistence of non-pietistic relatives, he attended
the University of Wittenberg to study law and to acquire such accomplishments
as dancing, fencing, and shooting, but he himself would
have preferred the study of theology.</p>
<p>At the age of 21, Zinzendorf bought an estate in Saxony with the
view of gathering a number of truly religious persons into a community,
which should be a source of new religious life. He invited a group of
Moravian exiles, a religious body which sprang from the work of John
Hus, to settle on the estate. Thus was formed, in 1722, the Moravian
settlement which took the name Herrnhut, &ldquo;Shelter of the Lord.&rdquo; The
colony grew rapidly and attracted to its numbers not only immigrants
from Moravia but many others. In 1727 Zinzendorf gave up his post as
an official at the Court of the King of Saxony, to join the Moravian
<span class="pb" id="Page_374">374</span>
colony and superintend the growing community. Accusing him of
spreading false doctrines, his opponents secured an edict from the king,
banishing Zinzendorf from Saxony. During this exile, which lasted 10
years, he was engaged in unceasing missionary efforts, from St. Petersburg
to the West Indies.</p>
<p>In 1741, Zinzendorf came to America to visit the Moravians in Pennsylvania
to organize them into congregations and encourage them to do
missionary work among both whites and Indians. Under his leadership,
the Moravians became a famous missionary group. As early as 1731,
two of the Brethren were sent to the West Indies and two to Greenland.
And in Zinzendorf&rsquo;s lifetime Moravians were at work in Europe, Asia,
Africa, North and South America. In a few years, the little colony at
Herrnhut had sent out more missionaries than had gone from all
European Protestantism during two centuries. They went to the hardest
and most dangerous places and the most unpromising peoples. Everywhere
they were strengthened by the joyful, confident faith and loyalty
to Christ expressed in Zinzendorf&rsquo;s hymn, &ldquo;Jesu geh voran.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Moravians had a powerful influence on hymnology. Zinzendorf
himself, all the members of his family, and most of the early leaders
wrote hymns. Singing was a prominent part of their worship and they
early began publishing hymnbooks. Concerning Zinzendorf&rsquo;s hymns,
Catherine Winkworth says in her <i>Christian Singers of Germany</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His hymns, of which he wrote more than two thousand,
are of exceedingly different value; some are fantastic and irreverent,
some mere rhymed prose, others again have a real
sweetness, fervour, and song in them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She cites &ldquo;Jesu geh voran&rdquo; as one of his best hymns.</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">SEELENBR&Auml;UTIGAM</span> is a tune of a &ldquo;pleasingly ingenious tinge,
very simply constructed.&rdquo; It is found in many English hymnbooks.</p>
<p>The composer, Adam Drese, 1620-1701, was born in Thuringia. He
became director of music at the Court of Count Wilhelm IV of Saxe-Weimar;
then was appointed kapellmeister in Weimar, and later at
Arnstadt, living meanwhile a life of selfish indulgence in the atmosphere
of the courts. Upon reading the works of Spener and Luther&rsquo;s <i>Introduction
to the Epistle to the Romans</i>, Drese experienced a spiritual
awakening which led him to aggressive missionary efforts and the organization
of prayer meetings in the community. He wrote hymns and
tunes which were sung at the meetings of pious persons in his house,
before they came into print.</p>
<p>The tune was first published in the <i>Hallesches Gesangbuch</i>, 1695,
but it was used in manuscript form as early as 1690, in the composer&rsquo;s
home.</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">DUNFERMLINE</span> is a Scottish tune of unknown origin. The
name is that of a town in Scotland. It appeared as one of the twelve
&ldquo;Common Tunes&rdquo; (tunes not attached to any particular psalms) in
<i>The CL Psalms of David, &amp;c.</i>, Edinburgh, 1615. In England the tune
was included in Ravencroft&rsquo;s <i>Whole Book of Psalms</i>, 1621.</p>
<h3 id="sect27">Note on the Scottish Psalter, 1650</h3>
<p>The origin of the <i>Scottish Psalter</i>, 1650, which is the source of nearly
all the metrical psalms in Book Five of the <i>Hymnary</i>, may be briefly
summarized as follows:</p>
<p>The church in Scotland, at the time of the Reformation, modeled its
service after Calvin&rsquo;s in Geneva. No hymns were permitted to be sung;
only the Words of inspired Scripture were allowed for use in worship.
For two hundred years after Luther had inspired a rich treasury of
&ldquo;man-made&rdquo; poems for use in congregational singing, the Calvinistic
churches were still using only psalms and paraphrases of Scripture.</p>
<p>In compiling a Psalter, the Scottish reformers adopted the entire
<i>Anglo-Genevan Psalter</i> used by John Knox, to which they added selections
from the English <i>Old Version</i> by Sternhold and Hopkins,
and 21 more by Scottish writers. Tunes, over 100 in all, were adopted
from the Anglo-Genevan, French, and English Psalters, in each case the
<span class="pb" id="Page_376">376</span>
melody only being printed. In 1635 an edition was published with the
tunes in harmony, the work of Edmund Millar.</p>
<p>In 1643, the House of Commons and the Westminster Assembly, interested
in establishing uniformity of worship between the churches of
England and Scotland, voted to adopt Francis Rous&rsquo; version of the
psalms for use throughout the kingdom, after extensive revisions of the
work. The Scottish church, not satisfied with the Rous&rsquo; version, appointed
a commission of four men to revise it still farther, largely to
satisfy the Puritan demand for more literalness to the Hebrew original.
The result of this revision was the classic <i>Scottish Psalter</i> of 1650, still
in use in Scottish Presbyterianism and in American Covenanter
Churches. The renderings are quaint and rude in spots but their faithfulness
and vigor cannot be denied. It is in this form that millions of
people have learned to love the psalms and all attempts to improve or
modernize them have so far failed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no tunes were provided with the <i>Scottish Psalter</i> of
1650. This limited the singing to such tunes as precentor and people
knew by heart, resulting in a long period of decline in church music
in the Church of Scotland. Later editions corrected this defect. In
1929, the General Assemblies of the Church of Scotland and the United
Free Church of Scotland, then entered into union, published a new
edition of the <i>Scottish Psalter</i>, with 192 tunes.</p>

<p>Andrew Thomson, 1778-1831, trained in the University of Edinburgh,
was an outstanding Scottish Presbyterian preacher and leading public
figure in Edinburgh. He had musical gifts and set himself to improve
the psalmody of his church and composed a number of tunes. In
collaboration with his precentor, R. A. Smith, he compiled several
collections of psalms and hymns. He also published books of sermons
and lectures and wrote numerous magazine articles. Thomson died

great need.</p>
<p>Most of our metrical psalms in the <i>Hymnary</i> are from the <i>Scottish
Psalter</i>, 1650. (See under <a href="#hymn_575">Hymn 575</a>.) But this one is from the revised

<span class="pb" id="Page_379">379</span>
England in 1696, by the two Irishmen, Tate and Brady. This version
partly supplanted in England the older version of Sternhold and
Hopkins.</p>
<p>Nahum Tate, 1652-1715, son of an Irish clergyman, was a literary
man, playwright, and a poet. Finally, to the surprise of everyone, he
became poet laureate, by appointment of William III.</p>
<p>Nicholas Brady, 1659-1726?, received the degree of D.D. from Dublin
University and had a varied clerical career in Ireland and England,
finally becoming chaplain to King William. Brady and Tate collaborated
to produce the <i>New Version</i>, a work which received royal
endorsement and was officially adopted in England. Though better
in smoothness and literary grace than the versions of Sternhold and
Hopkins, very little of it remains in modern hymnals. This hymn and
&ldquo;As pants the hart,&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_586">586</a>), are among the gems still in use. &ldquo;While
shepherds watched their flocks by night&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_73">73</a> and <a href="#hymn_74">74</a>) a masterly adaptation

was set to Psalm 15, arranged so that the first two lines should be sung
as a duet by soprano and alto, repeated as a duet by tenor and bass,
and then the third and fourth lines sung in full chorus. The present
form of the tune is first found in Scotland in Robert Gilmore&rsquo;s <i>Psalm
Singer&rsquo;s Assistant</i> (undated, but before 1793).</p>
<p>Samuel Arnold, 1740-1802, after ventures and heavy losses in the
theater business, received the degree of Mus. Doc. from Oxford and
then became organist and composer to the Royal Chapel. Later he
became conductor at the Academy of Ancient Music, and in 1789 was
appointed organist of Westminster Abbey. He wrote numerous songs,
<span class="pb" id="Page_380">380</span>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">SPOHR</span> is an adaptation from the solo and chorus, &ldquo;Though

<p>Ludwig Spohr, 1784-1859, a German musician, born at Brunswick,
was a composer and noted violinist. He went annually on concert
tours throughout Europe, with brilliant success. Few musicians have
enjoyed so high a reputation with their contemporaries. Many musicians
of his time considered Spohr a greater composer than Beethoven.
His reputation, however, did not stand the test of time, partly because
his compositions are characterized by a peculiar chromaticism. Most of
his numerous works, including operas, oratorios, 34 string quartets, violin
concertos, etc., have been forgotten. His oratorios, <i>Calvary</i> and
<i>The Last Judgment</i>, lasted longest.</p>
<p>The tune, &ldquo;St. Anne,&rdquo; now fittingly sung to &ldquo;O God our help in
ages past,&rdquo; (<a href="#hymn_61">No. 61</a>), was composed for this psalm, and may be used as

Psalm 36:9: &ldquo;For with Thee is the fountain of life; in Thy light do
we see light.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">FARRANT</span> is adapted from an air in the anthem, &ldquo;Lord, for

and by others to William Mundy.</p>

&ldquo;<i>The Whole Booke of Psalmes with their wonted Tunes, as they are

authors</i>,&rdquo; London, Thomas Este, 1592, where it is set to Psalm 84.</p>
<p>Thomas Este, 1540?-1608?, was a London printer and music publisher.
He printed an important edition of the psalter in 1592 in which the
tunes were harmonized in four parts by ten eminent musicians of the
time. In his dedicatory word Este wrote: &ldquo;In this booke the Church
Tunes are carefully corrected, and other short tunes added, which are
sung in London and other places of this Realme.&rdquo; The Church Tunes
(known also as Proper Tunes), forty-six in all, were attached to their
proper psalms and the remaining psalms were set to short, four line
tunes, Common Tunes, not attached to any particular psalms. Este&rsquo;s
book is the earliest example in which the voice parts are printed on
opposite pages&mdash;&ldquo;Cantus and Tenor (i.e. the Melody) on the left-hand
page, and the Altus and Bassus on the right&rdquo;&mdash;instead of in separate
books as was then the custom. New editions of <i>Este&rsquo;s Psalter</i>, with slight
changes, were published in 1594, 1604, and 1611. In the 19th century
it had the honor of being reprinted by the Musical Antiquarian Society
of England.</p>

<p>The psalmist prays for pardon and cleansing, confessing the greatness

the fourth of the seven psalms known from ancient times as the Penitential
Psalms. The others are 6, 32, 38, 102, 130, and 143.</p>

<div class="author"><i>Scottish Psalter</i>, 1650</div>
<p>Psalm 100. The Faithful God.</p>
<p>The Psalm was used as a processional hymn to be chanted by the
people as they went up to the temple for worship.</p>
<p>Sclater, in <i>The Public Worship of God</i>, discussing opening hymns of
adoration, says: &ldquo;There is none better than that grand old Puritan anthem,
the 100th Psalm, set to Louis Bourgeois&rsquo; noble tune,&rdquo; and adds
that &ldquo;those who are in perplexity to find hymns which precisely fit into
various parts of the service might do a great deal worse than take a look
at the Scottish Metrical Psalms. They will find them peculiarly rich
in the noblest and simplest form of opening adoration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In verse 4 the printer has omitted the question mark (?) after the
word &ldquo;why,&rdquo; in the early editions of the <i>Hymnary</i>.</p>
<p>William Kethe, to whom this version is ascribed, was one of the
exiles with John Knox in Geneva during the persecutions of Mary,
Queen of the Scots. Little is known of him but his name has been
immortalized by this justly renowned paraphrase of Psalm 100.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> <span class="small">OLD HUNDREDTH</span> is the most famous of all Psalm tunes. It
was adapted from a secular source by L. Bourgeois for Psalm 134 in the
<i>Genevan Psalter</i> of 1551. In later collections&mdash;the Genevan <i>Fourscore
and Seven Psalms of David</i>, and John Day&rsquo;s <i>Whole Book of Psalms</i>, both
published in 1561&mdash;the tune was attached to Kethe&rsquo;s version of Psalm
<span class="pb" id="Page_384">384</span>
100 and has remained associated with this Psalm ever since. The tune
is one of 46 known as &ldquo;Proper&rdquo; or &ldquo;Church&rdquo; tunes which are distinguished
by the adjective &ldquo;Old&rdquo; prefixed to the number of the psalm to
which they were attached. A later form of the melody, introduced
about the middle of the 18th century, is widely used with the &ldquo;Doxology&rdquo;
(<a href="#hymn_618">No. 618</a>).</p>

<p>Psalm 103:1-5. The Goodness of God.</p>
<p>The psalm sets forth with exquisite beauty and tenderness the enduring
goodness and mercy of God. It is a song of thanksgiving to God for
his many benefits and blessings.</p>
<p>It was the custom in Scotland to sing the opening verses of this
psalm as a song of thanksgiving and praise after the communicants had
received the bread and wine of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. The people poured
evangelical content into the words, thinking as they sang, of the great
redemption through Jesus Christ: &ldquo;who doth redeem thy life, etc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A response to be sung by choir or congregation or both after public
prayer.</p>
<p>George Whelpton, 1847-1930, composer of the tune, was born at
Redbourne, England, but came to America with his parents when he
was a child of four years. He studied music under H. R. Palmer and
with a private teacher in Boston. He became a well-known choir director
in Buffalo and served as editor of various publications. He died
suddenly at Oxford, Ohio.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_605">605. Thy word have I hid in my heart</h3>
<p>A response suitable for use in connection with the reading of the

<p>No biographical information regarding the composer, E. D. Beale,
has been ascertained.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_606">606. Gloria Patri</h3>
<p>An ancient canticle which is used in the service to give a trinitarian
form to Old Testament unitarianism.</p>
<p>The first part, &ldquo;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy
Ghost,&rdquo; was used very early in the apostolic era of the church, as the
common doxology. The second part, &ldquo;As it was in the beginning, is
now, and ever shall be, world without end,&rdquo; was added by the Western
Church during the second and third centuries when the Arian controversy
raised the question as to whether the God of the Old Testament
is the same as the God manifested in Christ in the New Testament.
The answer, incorporated in the song, was an affirmative. It was always
sung after the Psalms to give them a New Testament or Trinitarian
ending. This is still the chief use of the Gloria Patri, though it is attached
sometimes to some other part of the service. Concerning this
point, Dr. Henry Sloan Coffin says: &ldquo;In view of the origin of the Gloria
Patri and its long historical association with the Psalms, it is vandalism
to tear it from its proper context, and attach it to something else in
the service.&rdquo; (<i>The Public Worship of God</i>, Westminster Press, p. 101).</p>

<p><i>MUSIC.</i> The tune was composed by Charles Meineke, 1782-1850, a
German pianist and organist who came to America in 1810. For a time
he was organist at St. Paul&rsquo;s Church, Baltimore.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_608">608. Let the words of my mouth</h3>
<p>From Psalm 19:14.</p>
<p>Prayer, &ldquo;uttered or unexpressed,&rdquo; is a spiritual sacrifice. The sentence
is used in the Jewish liturgy at the close of silent worship. If
sung in a quiet mood, the response is suitable for use by soloist, choir,
or congregation, before or after pastoral prayer of the worship service.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> The music was composed by Adolph Baumbach, 1830-80,
teacher of piano and organ and composer of instrumental and choir
music. Baumbach was born in Germany about 1830, came to America
in 1855, and lived in Boston and Chicago.</p>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_609">609. Father, O hear us</h3>
<p>Anonymous.</p>
<p>Suitable for use as a response after prayer, or before a prayer of
special petition, as in the case of Elijah in I Kings 18:37: &ldquo;hear me, O
Lord, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the Lord God.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="b">THE LORD&rsquo;S PRAYER</h4>
<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_610">610. Our Father, who art in heaven</h3>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, as found in Matthew 6:9-13.</p>
<p>The prayer which Christ taught the disciples is in its comprehensiveness
a pattern of prayer and may well be used in the prayers of the
church.</p>
<p><i>MUSIC.</i> The musical setting is from a Gregorian Chant. In singing
it, the following general directions for chanting may be found useful:</p>
<p>1. Chants consist of two distinct divisions, one portion is recited, the
other portion is sung.</p>
<p>2. The words from the beginning of each line up to the accented
word, which is printed in italics, are called the Recitation, and should
be sung smoothly, without undue haste, and observing stops (,) as in
good reading. The Recitation may be of any length. The note on
which it is sung is called the Reciting note.</p>
<p>3. On reaching the accented word and beginning with it, sing in
strict time. If there is no syllable after that which is accented, as, for
example, in &ldquo;Thy Kingdom <i>come</i>,&rdquo; the accented syllable is held for
the time value of one whole measure.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_611">611. Bless Thou the gifts our hands have brought</h3>
<div class="author"><i>Samuel Longfellow</i>, 1819-92</div>
<p>An offertory hymn to be sung by the choir or congregation or both.</p>
<p>For comments on the author, Samuel Longfellow, see <a href="#hymn_28">Hymn 28</a>.</p>
<p>Concerning the place of the collection in the worship service, Henry
Sloan Coffin says in his excellent book on public worship:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether the collection be made in the middle of the service
or near its conclusion, it should be an act of worship. The
gifts of the people should be carried up to the holy table, and
received and placed upon it by the minister. While they are
brought up, the congregation may stand and sing a dedication,
&ldquo;All things come of Thee, O Lord, and of thine own have we
given Thee,&rdquo; or a similar sentence. This may be varied by
using Ken&rsquo;s familiar doxology, or a verse from an appropriate
hymn, such as Bishop How&rsquo;s &ldquo;We give Thee but Thine own.&rdquo;
When the Offering is for a cause&mdash;missions or a hospital or the
Bible Society&mdash;a stanza from a hymn which fits the purpose may
be selected for use as the dedication and be printed on the
order of worship in the calendar. A minister may use a prayer
in the act of dedication, but it is difficult to find variety in its
expression, and the prayer should usually be comprised in a
short sentence. Congregations are helped to realize that in this
act they are the offerers if they join the choir in singing the
dedication. (<i>The Public Worship of God</i>, Westminster Press,
1946.) Quoted by permission.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_612">612. All things come of Thee, O Lord</h3>
<p>From 1 Chron. 29:14.</p>
<p>This is one of the mostly widely used offertory responses, usually sung
by a congregation during the consecration of the offering.</p>
<p>The setting of the words is significant in its conception of the spirit
of sacrifice and worship. David was assembling the material with
which Solomon might build the temple. The people and leaders
brought their gifts, all voluntarily, with no mention of a tithe or temple
tax. Gratitude for what God had done for them stirred their generosity
and they counted it a privilege to give back to God what came to them
from His hand.</p>

from which it comes has not been identified.</p>

<h3 class="hymn" id="hymn_619">619. Dresden Amen</h3>
<p>A cadence, or ending, much used in ecclesiastical music in the
Royal Chapel of Dresden (common also throughout Saxony). Wagner
immortalized it in his <i>Parsifal</i> and the tune also appears in Mendelssohn&rsquo;s
<i>Reformation Symphony</i>, Stanford&rsquo;s <i>Service in B flat</i>, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The composer, Johann Gottlieb Naumann (or Giovanni Amadeo),
1741-1801, well-known musician in his day, was born at Blasewitz, near
Dresden, the son of peasant parents. He was a successful opera composer
in Saxony, Italy, Sweden, and Prussia. Naumann was also a prolific
composer of church music: 13 oratorios, 21 masses with <i>Te Deums</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_393">393</span>
and smaller church pieces. Some of his compositions are still in use. His

<h3 id="sect28">NOTE ON THE USE OF &ldquo;AMEN&rdquo;</h3>
<p>In the Jewish and early Christian Church, the people said &ldquo;Amen&rdquo;
after prayers were offered. Cf. I Cor. 14:16. In so doing, they gave
a deliberate endorsement to what had been said or sung. The &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo;
meaning &ldquo;so be it,&rdquo; should be sung with conviction, not thoughtlessly
or half-heartedly, as if what went before is of doubtful importance.</p>
<p>The settings given here are principally for use by the choir after the
pastoral prayer or at the close of a service, in churches where such
musical elaboration is practiced.</p>
<p>The use of &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; after a hymn is optional. If sung well, it serves
as a satisfying concluding formula. Its use is entirely appropriate only
with those hymns which are prayer, praise, or otherwise addressed to
God.</p>
<p>The first instance of its use at the end of a hymn is in a curious
hymn book entitled, <i>Seven Sobs of a Sorrowful Soul for Sinne</i>, published
in England in 1583. During the last century most editors of
hymnals have adopted the custom of adding the &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; to all hymns.
The <i>Songs of Praise</i>, published in England in 1933, is a notable exception.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
